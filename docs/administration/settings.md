This page provides an overview of the settings available in your Prophecy user account. Each tab in the user settings panel allows you to manage a different aspect of your account, such as personal information, team membership, Git credentials, access tokens, and deployment details.

Navigate to settings by clicking **...** in the left navigation menu and the **gear** icon.

## Tabs

Within the **Settings** UI, you will find the following tabs.

| Tab          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Info         | In the **Info** tab, you can update your name and company, change your password, or delete your account. Deleting your account is irreversible and will permanently remove all associated data from Prophecy, including personal teams, projects, and fabrics.                                        |
| Teams        | In the **Team** tab, you can view all teams you belong to, create new teams, and view the users in each team. You can also add or remove users from your teams and modify user roles, such as assigning a user as a team admin.                                                                       |
| Git          | In the **Git** tab, you can review your current Git credentials. Prophecy-Managed Git is provided by default. You can also add new Git credentials or edit and delete existing ones. These credentials are used during project creation and are required to store Prophecy project metadata and code. |
| Access Token | In the **Access Token** tab, you can review both active and inactive Personal Access Tokens. You can also create new Personal Access Tokens to securely access [Prophecy APIs](/api).                                                                                                                 |
| About        | The **About** tab shows the current version of the Prophecy deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
