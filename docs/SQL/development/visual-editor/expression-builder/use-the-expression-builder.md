Develop your SQL expressions by using the Expression Builder, which shows you available columns and functions that you can use to build your expressions.

## Navigate

To navigate to the Spark Expression Builder, go to the column you want to edit, and open the expanded editor. Here click on the Expression Builder button. From there, you can search and insert functions onto the canvas and specify their arguments. This tool can save you time and effort when constructing complex expressions, and can help you to better understand the relationships between different functions and their arguments.

## Build

- Data transformation
- Filter & Join
- Aggregation
- Sort

## Run and Verify the output

Run the Pipeline up to and including the Gem with your expression, and observe the resulting data sample.

- Click the **Play** button on either the canvas or the Gem.

Once the code has finished running, you can verify the results to make sure they match your expectations. This Data is same as what you see in [interims view](../interactive-development/data-explorer.md). By testing and verifying your expressions, you can ensure that your data analysis tasks are accurate and reliable.
