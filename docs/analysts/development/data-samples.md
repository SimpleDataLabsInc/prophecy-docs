During project development, you can interactively run your pipelines and analyze the interim data samples that result from the pipelines.

## Interactive execution

Running your pipeline during development can help you understand how your data is being transformed.

For instance, when you configure a new gem in the pipeline, you might want to inspect its output. You can produce the data sample in two ways:

1. Run the pipeline.
1. Run up to and including the gem.

Data samples appear between gems in the pipeline. When you open a data sample, you can sort the data, filter the data, export the data, or create a new gem.

## Data profiling

Data samples also include data profiles for your interim data.
