Business applications package complex pipelines into easy-to-use applications for non-technical users. This can help you in a variety of ways.

- Templated pipelines let you quickly run pipelines and generate reports, without having to engineer pipelines from scratch.
- Reusable apps help teams collaborate more effectively, as everyone can reuse apps without duplicating effort.
- Running pipelines through business apps reduces the risk of errors by providing pre-defined paths and operations that have been tested and vetted.

## Capabilities

Business apps resemble forms that are easy to understand and fill out. They offer the following capabilities.

- Upload data to overwrite pipeline sources.
- Assign values to [pipeline parameters](/analysts/development/pipelines#parameters).
- See live data previews.
- Download data outputs.
- Schedule app execution.

## Directory

All business apps can be accessed from the App Directory. Each business app is associated with one pipeline (one-to-one relationship).

You'll be able to view and use business apps that have been shared with your team.

Apps will always run on the last published version of the associated data pipeline.

## Creation

Business apps are created inside projects. Visit our guide on [app creation](docs/analysts/business-apps/app-creation.md) for more details.
