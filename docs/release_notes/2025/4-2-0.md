## Prophecy for Analysts

### Features {#analyst-features}

The following features are available in this release.

- We have released two new editions of Prophecy for analysts: Free and Professional Edition. Free and Professional Editions are designed for data analysts who want to collaborate without managing infrastructure. Both editions provide Prophecy-managed resources that are metered by credits.

  Review the [Prophecy Editions](docs/getting-started/editions/editions.md) page for a full comparison between Free, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Prophecy.

- You can now use Prophecy's AI Agent to [generate pipeline documentation](docs/analysts/development/ai-agent/ai-documentation.md). Instead of writing documentation manually, this lets you create detailed specifications automatically.

  - [Regex](/analysts/regex): Enables pattern matching and text extraction using regular expressions.
  - [GCS Source and Target](/analysts/gcs-gem): Read from or write to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets.
