In a **Basic Subgraph**, you have the capability to encapsulate multiple distinct Gems within a single, reusable parent Gem. This organizational approach enhances the visual clarity of your Pipeline by grouping various sections together under a common parent Gem. Additionally, it empowers users to break down intricate logic into modular components, thereby streamlining the Data Engineering process.

Furthermore, the ability to [Publish a Subgraph](/docs/package-hub/package-builder/ShareableSubgraphs.md) extends the utility beyond a singular Pipeline. By doing so, you can reuse the encapsulated logic in other pipelines or projects, promoting code re-usability and simplifying the overall development workflow.
