This is an extended maintenance release. Learn more in [Prophecy versions support](docs/release_notes/version_chart/versions_support.md).

## Features

The following enhancement is available in this release.

- Databricks connections in Prophecy fabrics accept [service principal](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/users-groups/service-principals) credentials for OAuth.

  Now you can deploy scheduled pipelines using the service principal credentials. To learn more, visit the [Databricks connection](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/connections/databricks) documentation.

## Fixes

The following fixes are available in this release.

- Multiple fixes have been completed to ensure security and stability for this extended maintenance release.

- We have updated `tornado` and `jupyter_core` in the Python sandbox to address [CVE-2025-47287](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-47287) and [CVE-2025-30167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30167), respectively.
