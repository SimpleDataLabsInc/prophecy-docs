## 2.9.0.0 (Mar 16, 2023)

- Prophecy Python libs version: 1.4.7
- Prophecy Scala libs version: 7.0.10

### Updates {#UpdatesRelease290}

#### Sharable Subgraphs and UDFs

One of the best practices during Data-Project development is to _Use standardized components_. Prophecy enables this standardization in a few ways:

1. Our standard Gems
2. User-Defined Functions
3. Reusable Subgraphs
4. Custom Gems

With this release, `Subgraph`s and `User-Defined Function`s can now be shared across multiple projects and teams. This allows central Data Platform teams to build reusable code to cover a wide variety of business needs, such as Encryption/Decryption or Identity Masking, and have their "consumers" (the Data Practitioners) take a dependency on that reusable code. Since it's all versioned, when the reusable code changes, the downstream consumers will be notified and can update accordingly.

Data admins can also _Create deployment templates for the pipelines_ that have the best practices baked into them for authorization, notifications,
handling of errors, and logging the correct information.

:::info
Please note, Users will see new Uncommitted changes in their Pipelines when they open it. They can see UDF code being added to all Pipelines, Configs added to Subgraphs, etc.

#### Ability to commit and Release from the Pipeline page

A user can complete the entire CI-CD process from `commit` to `release` from the Pipeline editor. Please see the below video for an example.

</div>

### Improvements {#ImprovementsRelease290}

#### Ability to rename a cluster while attaching

When attaching to a cluster, User can now provide a custom name to the cluster (if creating a new cluster), to be able to identify it in the future again.
Please see the below video for an example.

<div style={{position: 'relative', 'padding-bottom': '56.25%', height: 0}}>
   <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/d28f3ba9dd80482f983f5f7e753d1588" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}></iframe>
</div>

#### Checkout remote branches

Users can now check out branches created directly in Git(outside of Prophecy) for editing. On the checkout screen, users will now see a list of remote and local branches separately. Once checked out, the branch will be shown as a local branch.
Please see the below video for an example.

<div style={{position: 'relative', 'padding-bottom': '56.25%', height: 0}}>
   <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/cd9fb2c1a43940c98683b6451625bac1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}></iframe>
</div>

#### Open Project lineage view

When clicking `Open Project` from a Project page, Users will now see a Birds-eye view of their entire Project. They will have shortcuts to edit Pipelines and access all Metadata from this screen. Please see the below video for an example.

<div style={{position: 'relative', 'padding-bottom': '56.25%', height: 0}}>
   <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/69fcdee808af4b94844bd603ca93865e" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}></iframe>
</div>

#### Cluster auto-attach behaviour

For Configured Pipelines (Read-Only mode from Dependencies) in Pipeline view, Cluster will auto-attach to the `last-used` cluster from the Fabric. This behaviour is now consistent for all Pipelines in Edit/Read-Only mode.
Please see the below video for an example.

<div style={{position: 'relative', 'padding-bottom': '56.25%', height: 0}}>
   <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/09bb5a748d874382bbf6f6c0aebb3d25" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}></iframe>
</div>

#### Control Data Sampling behaviour for Configured Pipelines

A User can now change the Data Sampling([Interims](../low-code-spark/execution/interactive-execution#interims)) for Interactive Runs of Configured Pipelines(Read-Only mode from Dependencies).
Please see the below video for an example.

<div style={{position: 'relative', 'padding-bottom': '56.25%', height: 0}}>
   <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/a30e25b0cfc842c4b198f8c36349a879" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}></iframe>
</div>
