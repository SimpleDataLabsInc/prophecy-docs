### File upload in Spark Pipelines

There are now three ways to upload a file and incorporate it into your Spark Pipeline:

- Drag and drop the file directly onto the Pipeline canvas.
- Open the Source/Target Gem drawer and click **Upload file**.
- Create a new Source Gem, click **+ New Dataset**, and then select **Upload file**.

### Minor improvements {#MinorImprovements343}

- **SCIM user experience enhancements.** When SCIM is enabled, there is a new option under **Settings > SSO** that lets you easily generate a SCIM token.
- **Machine-to-Machine functionality with Databricks OAuth.** This feature lets you use Databricks OAuth for authentication during scheduled Jobs, as well as for Project releases and deployments. Visit the Databricks documentation to learn more about [access to Databricks with a Service Principal using OAuth](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).
