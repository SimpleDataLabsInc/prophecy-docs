### Features {#UpdatesRelease300}

#### SQL

#### Expression Builder

To perform data analysis and manipulation, Spark has provided various functions. These functions enable users to perform various data analysis tasks on their data.
In order to perform complex data analysis tasks, it's important to be able to construct expressions that combine the Spark functions in various ways.
Prophecy has now made this easy with support of **[Expression Builder](./../low-code-spark/expression-builder)**.
Using the Spark Expression Builder can save you time and effort when constructing complex expressions, and can help you to better understand the relationships between different functions and their arguments.
Please refer [here](./../low-code-spark/expression-builder) for Detailed documentation on this feature.

#### Data Quality (_Beta_)

Data quality refers to the accuracy, relevance, completeness, and consistency of data. In today's data-driven world, the quality of data is paramount to making informed decisions. Poor quality data can lead to incorrect decisions, which can have a significant impact on businesses and organizations.

There are several factors that affect data quality. These include data entry errors, data duplication, missing data, inconsistent data, and outdated data. These issues can arise from human error, system errors, or technical issues such as data integration problems.

In Prophecy, you, as a user, can now easily set **Expectations** on your data such as uniqueness, range, and more. You can then schedule these **Expectations** to run at fixed **Schedules**, and receive alerts whenever any mismatch occurs, empowering you to maintain the quality of your data.
Please refer [here](./../low-code-spark/data-quality) for Detailed documentation on this feature.
