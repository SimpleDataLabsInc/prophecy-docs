Prophecy offers a low-code development environment for Spark and SQL and interfaces with multiple execution engines. Snowflake and Databricks are a two great options to get started.

## Snowflake

Snowflake is supported by connecting to an existing Snowflake Warehouse directly. 

## Databricks

Databricks is supported by connecting to an existing Databricks Cluster or Warehouse directly, via Databricks Partner Connect for Prophecy's SaaS offering, or via Cloud Marketplaces for Prophecy's install in customer VPC. If you don't have a Databricks account, try Prophecy's Enterprise trial. Enterprise trial is valid for 14 days and a Databricks account is provided. You can try the features, but you will not be able to use your private data.
