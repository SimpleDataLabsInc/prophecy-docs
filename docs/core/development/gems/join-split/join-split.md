Join gems provide data enrichment and set operation capabilities for merging, combining, and comparing datasets. These gems enable you to connect related data from multiple sources, perform set operations, and create comprehensive datasets by combining information across different tables and data sources.

## Gems

Access the following gems from the Join category in the gem drawer.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
