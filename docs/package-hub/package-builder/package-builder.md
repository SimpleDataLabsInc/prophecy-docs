With **Package Builder**, engineering teams gain an intuitive tool for standardized creation of packaged operations, including Pipelines, Functions, Custom Gems, and more. You can now easily reuse code and enforce best practices across your data operations, eliminating manual and error-prone processes.

Create a Project with any combination of building blocks below. For example, the [custom Gem page](/docs/package-hub/package-builder/gem-builder.md) has detailed instructions on building a custom Gem within a Project. When you commit and release your Project with a version, you are now able to share the released Project as a *Package* dependency. Other teams can then re-use the components. Check out the [Package Hub](/docs/package-hub/package-hub.md) page for a deep dive on using Packages.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
