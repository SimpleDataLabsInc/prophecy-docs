Use the App Builder to design the interface for a Prophecy App. This is the form that end users will interact with to provide input data and trigger pipeline runs. End users will not need access the pipeline itself.

## Get started

To use the App Builder, you must:

- Have a pipeline built and saved in your project
- Define pipeline parameters to make the pipeline configurable

The App Builder is available inside any project. To get started, click **+** next to **Apps** in the left sidebar.

This opens a new app in the App Builder.

## Build the app interface

After creating a new app, use App Builder to design the UI:

- Add and configure components like dropdowns, data previews, charts, and images
- Map interactive components to pipeline parameters. This makes your pipeline dynamic. Each app run uses values entered by the end user.

## Manage app components

As you add components to your app, note the following tabs in the right sidebar:

- The **Layers** tab defines the order and organization of your components.
- The **Inspect** tab lets you configure component settings. This determines how components will appear and behave in your app.

:::info
If you make changes to a Prophecy App, these changes will immediately become available to end users. Because of this, you cannot edit Prophecy Apps if any user has the app open at the same time.
