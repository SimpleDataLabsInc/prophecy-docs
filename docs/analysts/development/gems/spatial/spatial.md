Spatial gems provide geospatial data processing capabilities for location-based analytics, geographic information systems (GIS), and spatial data transformations. These gems enable you to work with geographic coordinates, perform spatial calculations, and analyze geographic relationships in your data pipelines.

:::info
Spatial gems are available through the ProphecyDatabricksSqlSpatial [package](/engineers/package-hub). Some of these gems leverage Databricks' [ST geospatial functions](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-st-geospatial-functions), which require Databricks Runtime 17.1 and above.
