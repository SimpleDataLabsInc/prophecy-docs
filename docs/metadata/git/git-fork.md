This page describes how to fork a repository in cases where you may want to create a copy of the original repository.

## Use fork per user Git storage model

During the creation of Project there is an option to choose fork per usage as Git Storage model.
When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the original repository (upstream repository) but the repository remains on your GitHub account.

When using the fork per usage Git storage model while creating a new Project, apart from the `upstream repository` details, some additional information is needed for the `forked repository`.

Let's create a fork of our original repository and pull `main` branch from original repository to our newly created forked repository.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{padding:'56.25% 0 0 0', position:'relative'}}>
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style={{height:'100%',left:0,position:'absolute',top:0,width:'100%'}}>

</div></div>

Now to pull main branch from upstream repository or from origin of current repository is as simple as clicking on below
`Pull Upstream` or `Pull Origin` options.

:::note

1. Any changes made in forked repository would not effect the `upstream repository` and would only reflect in the `forked repository`.
2. Please follow the normal GÃŸit flow for raising pull requests to the `original repository` (upstream repository) from the `forked repository`.
