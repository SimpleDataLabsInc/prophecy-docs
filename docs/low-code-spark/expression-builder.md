To perform data analysis and manipulation, Spark has provided various functions. These functions enable users to perform various data analysis tasks on their data.
In order to perform complex data analysis tasks, it's important to be able to construct expressions that combine the Spark functions in various ways.
Prophecy has now made this easy with support of **Expression Builder**. Using the Spark Expression Builder can save you time and effort when constructing complex expressions, and can help you to better understand the relationships between different functions and their arguments.
