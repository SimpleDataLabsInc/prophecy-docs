## Create teams

Before you can invite users to Prophecy, you need to define the [teams](/administration/teams-users/teams-users) they will be invited to.

1. Go to **Metadata → Teams**.
1. Click **+ Create Team**.
1. In the **Basic Info** tab, define the team name.
1. Click **Continue**.
1. **[Enterprise Edition only]** Enable or disable Spark execution metrics for the team.
1. Click **Complete** to save the new team.

## Create users

After you define the teams, invite new users to those teams.

1. Go to **Metadata → Users**.
1. Click **+ Invite Users**.
1. In the **Invite User** dialog:

   - Enter one or more email addresses.
   - Select the team the user will join.
   - Choose a role: **User** or **Admin**.
   - Click **Send Invitation**.

The system creates the accounts and emails the invitation links to users.
