## How to resolve conflicts during merging

Now let's create a Project in `third_branch` with same name as `first_Pipeline` and put a different path in Dataset.
Post this once we pull the changes from `main` into this branch, it would have conflicts as `first_Pipeline` exists both in
`main` and `current` branch.

One way is to use the Git interface directly to resolve conflicts between branches.

Or we can use the simple merge UI on Prophecy to resolve the conflicts

Let's see in the video below on how to resolve conflicts using simple merge on Prophecy:

## How to use fork per user Git storage model

During the creation of Project there is an option to choose fork per usage as Git Storage model.
When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the original repository (upstream repository) but the repository remains on your GitHub account.

When using the fork per usage Git storage model while creating a new Project, apart from the `upstream repository` details, some additional information is needed for the `forked repository`.

Let's create a fork of our original repository and pull `main` branch from original repository to our newly created forked repository.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style={{padding:'56.25% 0 0 0', position:'relative'}}>
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style={{height:'100%',left:0,position:'absolute',top:0,width:'100%'}}>
<iframe src="https://user-images.Githubusercontent.com/103921419/174733053-a45b61e3-1ebb-4ca2-99d9-5ad0d8b67ddb.mp4" title="How to create fork" allow="autoplay;fullscreen" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>
</div></div>

Now to pull main branch from upstream repository or from origin of current repository is as simple as clicking on below
`Pull Upstream` or `Pull Origin` options

:::note

1. Any changes made in forked repository would not effect the `upstream repository` and would only reflect in the `forked repository`.
2. Please follow the normal GÃŸit flow for raising pull requests to the `original repository` (upstream repository) from the `forked repository`.
