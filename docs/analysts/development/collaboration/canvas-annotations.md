In many cases, pipelines can become quite large to accommodate complex transformation requirements. Because of this, Prophecy lets you **annotate** your pipelines in the canvas to contextualize them.

## Add an annotation

To add an annotation to a pipeline:

1. Open a pipeline in a project.
1. Click on the annotate button in the bottom left corner of the canvas.
1. Drag the text box to your desired location in the canvas.
1. Add your own text or image to the annotation.
1. Format the text using the formatting toolbar.

## Example

Exposing important code blocks of certain gems.
