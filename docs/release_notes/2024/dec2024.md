- Prophecy Python libs version: 1.9.24
- Prophecy Scala libs version: 8.5.0

### Features {#Features342}

#### Monitor and alert for resource utilization

Prophecy now offers a reliable solution for configuring alerts to monitor resource usage in Prophecy-managed microservices.

![Alert Config](./img/nov-alert-config.png)

It enables proactive alerting when resource utilization approaches defined thresholds, ensuring timely intervention before limits are reached. Additionally, it supports the suspension of critical services in the event of resource overflows.

For more information, see Alerts Configuration.

### Minor Improvements {#MinorImprovements342}

- **Execution Metrics bug fix**: We fixed a bug where Execution Metrics is disabled but turns on during interactive execution.

- **Blank config package field bug fix**: We fixed a bug where a Python Pipeline would crash after clearing the config package name and then attempting to save.
