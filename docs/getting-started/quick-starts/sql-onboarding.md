To get started with Prophecy, you can use the in-product walkthrough for a SQL model or Spark pipeline. This page will describe the **SQL** onboarding option. If you have completed this walkthrough, you can always return to it again.

## Get started

1. Open the Prophecy homepage.
1. Click **Onboarding**.
1. Select **Low-code SQL**.

This opens up the visual model canvas! As you begin, notice that Prophecy automatically attaches to a SQL cluster. We provide a default [fabric](docs/getting-started/concepts/fabrics.md) (execution environment) for this onboarding project.

## Follow the steps

In this onboarding quick start, follow the orange dot in the product interface to click through the tutorial.

You can automatically go through steps by clicking **Auto-connect Gems** or **Auto-configure the Gem**. You can also select **Skip** to complete the entire model design.

At a high level, this walkthrough helps you:

1. Add input data to your model with a Source gem.
1. Configure a join using the Join gem.
1. Use a Reformat gem to rename columns.
1. Understand how to use the expression editor with the help of the Data Copilot.
1. Group data using a SQL expression in an Aggregate gem.
1. Explore both the visual and code editor views.
1. Run the model and view interim datasets.

## What's next

The in-product walkthrough has helped familiarize you with the visual canvas. Next, you can create your own project and do more with your data!
