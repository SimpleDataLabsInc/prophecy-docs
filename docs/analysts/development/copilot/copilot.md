Copilot is your intelligent assistant for building and understanding data pipelines. It helps you:

- Generate gems and pipelines using natural language.
- Speed up data transformation with smart, context-aware suggestions.
- Label and explain parts of a pipeline for better documentation and collaboration.
- Detect and correct errors automatically.

## Generate gems and pipelines

- Ask copilot
- Click next gem prediction
- Business spec to pipeline gen

### Example prompts {#example-prompts-gems}

## Expression building

- Prompts in the expression builder in the visual and code view of gems
- Automatic suggestions: Copilot relies on semantic hints from **column names** to generate accurate transformations and suggestions.
  - `customer_email` → Recognizable intent.
  - `col1` → Ambiguous name that could lead to incorrect suggestions.
