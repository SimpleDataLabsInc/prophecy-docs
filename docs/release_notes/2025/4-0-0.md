Starting in Prophecy 4.0.0, our product caters to two audiences: data engineers and business analysts. As we keep making our Spark offerings better for engineers, we're also adding new, easy-to-use tools for business analysts to fulfill a [comprehensive platform approach](https://www.prophecy.io/blog/data-engineers-and-business-data-users-end-the-back-and-forth). While **Prophecy for Analysts** is completely new, **Prophecy for Engineers** is our traditional Spark product.

## Prophecy for Analysts

### Features {#features-analysts}

The following are features available in this release.

- [Prophecy fabrics](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/) to accommodate native orchestration with [Prophecy Automate](/administration/architecture).

- [Connections](/analysts/connections) to a wide variety of data providers that can be used throughout pipelines and shared with teammates.

- [Business applications](/analysts/business-applications) to enable non-technical users to run pipelines with built-in guardrails.

- [A new set of gems](/analysts/gems) to let you ingest, transform, parse, clean, and write data in the visual pipeline canvas.

- [Simplified versioning](/analysts/versioning) to streamline your project workflow, while still following Git best practices.

- [Monitoring](/analysts/monitoring) in the Observability page for tracking deployed projects and pipeline schedules.

- [Data profiling](/analysts/data-explorer) in the Data Explorer for quick statistics on your data.

- [Collaboration capabilities](/analysts/collaboration) to bridge the gap between teams and speed up time to production.

- [Extensibility features](/analysts/extensibility) to let you build custom components for projects and add additional functionality to Prophecy.

:::note
These features are only available for projects that leverage [Prophecy fabrics](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/).
