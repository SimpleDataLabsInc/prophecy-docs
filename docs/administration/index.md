This documentation is designed to help administrators effectively manage users, resources, and configurations. There are two types of administrators: team admins and prophecy cluster admins. The navigation is divided by admin type to easily find relevant tasks.

### Team admins

Team admins manage teams and create resources for their teams.

For more information about teams, visit [Teams and users](docs/administration/teamuser.md).

### Prophecy cluster admins

Prophecy cluster admins manage clusters, infrastructure, compute resources, and Prophecy deployment.

For more information about infrastructure, visit [Architecture](docs/administration/architecture.md).

### Troubleshooting

For support or help troubleshooting, visit our [Getting help](docs/getting-help) section.
