Prophecy installation requires a Kubernetes cluster. Its installation and upgrades are managed by our infrastructure management plane called `Athena`.
Athena is installed through helm chart which internally deploys Prophecy Kubernetes Operator to manage different Prophecy services.

## Requirements

To install Prophecy, the following infrastructure requirements must be satisfied:

- **Kubernetes Version (minimum):** 1.14
- **Helm** client to install Prophecy Helm chart
- **Container Registry:** Prophecy publishes all its docker images in GCR(Google Container Registry: `gcr.io/prophecy-share`).
  Kubernetes cluster should be able to pull images from here. Alternatively, customers can use their internal container registry
  which needs to be pre-populated with images from GCR by them. Details of the images to be pulled are given below.
- **Namespace** in Kubernetes cluster to install Prophecy
- **CRDs installation:** Since the installation is primarily done by Prophecy Kubernetes operator which works on a custom resource,
  CRDs installation is a must before the rest of the components can be installed. Note that only this operation requires a cluster-wide role.
- **Persistent Storage with Dynamic Provisioning:** A few Prophecy services require persistent storage. With Prophecy Operator not expecting a cluster-wide role for installation,
  it becomes necessary to have dynamic provisioning enabled for persistent volumes (e.g. `gp2`)
- **Ingress Controller:** To expose a few services externally on a hostname/FQDN, Prophecy installs its own managed Nginx ingress controller.
  If the Kubernetes cluster already has one running we can leverage that. Note that the Nginx controller service is exposed via a `LoadBalancer` type
  service and hence the creation of external `LoadBalancer`s should be allowed within the cluster.
- **Hostname Resolution and SSL Certificate:** Installed Prophecy services can either be exposed on Prophecy's domain `*.cloud.prophecy.io` or via a
  customer-owned domain. For Prophecy's domain, we are responsible for ensuring the resolution of the hostname and managing SSL certs (issued by Let's Encrypt) via our
  Controlcenter service hosted in our infrastructure. For customer-owned domains, the customer is responsible for managing SSL certs and
  hostname resolution (by making entries in a DNS zone).
- Connectivity from Kubernetes cluster to **Spark Environment** (Databricks, Livy, etc.) and vice-versa.

## Installation Instructions

As mentioned above, Prophecy is installed via Helm chart whose values can be set as below based on the requirement.
