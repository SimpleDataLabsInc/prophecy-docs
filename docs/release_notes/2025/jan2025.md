#### Databricks OAuth integration

Prophecy has integrated with Databricks OAuth in order to provide you with increased security via industry-standard authentication flows.

You will see a login overlay in Prophecy, such as when selecting a Fabric, where Databricks API interactions are required.

The Databricks OAuth setup must be completed by both your Databricks Account Admin and your Prophecy Team Admin.

For more information on how it works and how to set it up, see [Databricks OAuth](../../architecture/self-hosted/authentication/databricks-oauth.md).

#### Active and Total Users APIs

You can use the Active Users and Total Users APIs to find out the number of current and total users who are logged in to Prophecy. This can help you understand usage and times of high traffic, enabling you to manage capacity more effectively.

For more information on the APIs, see [Active and Total Users](../../concepts/teamuser.md#active-and-total-users).

### Minor Improvements {#MinorImprovements342}

- **"Offset" column name bug fix**: We fixed a bug where naming a column using a Snowflake reserved keyword, such as "Offset", would break when using a Reformat Gem.
