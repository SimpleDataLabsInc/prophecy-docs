## Features

The following are features and improvements available in this release.

- You can now sort, filter, and search through your data in the [Data Explorer](/engineers/data-explorer) without rerunning the gem.

- We've added the [Selective](/engineers/data-sampling#selective-recommended) sampling setting to let you enable or disable data samples for individual gems.

- We now support Snowflake as a connection on our Prophecy-managed Airflow fabric.

- To change role restrictions for fabric-level [data sampling settings](/engineers/execution), we have introduced two new flags that you can enable on your Prophecy deployment.

  - `ALLOW_FABRIC_ACCESS_CLUSTER_ADMIN`: Grants cluster admins full access to fabrics, even if they are not team admins.

  - `DISALLOW_FABRIC_CODEDEPS_UPDATE_TEAM_ADMIN`: Prevents team admins from modifying the data sampling settings within a fabric.
