## 2.6.0.0 (February 3 2023)

- Prophecy Python libs version: 6.3.20
- Prophecy Scala libs version: 1.3.22

### New Features

#### GCP Support

Prophecy now has support for integrating through Databricks Partner Connect on GCP. For example, when Databricks is deployed and running on GCP and integration between Prophecy and Databricks is needed, the user can integrate with Prophecy through Databricks Partner Connect.

#### Interims for Unity Catalog Workspaces

Pipelines running on **Unity Catalog cluster** now has ability to show [Vanilla interims](../low-code-spark/execution/executions_on_databricks_clusters#vanilla-interims) on all Actions/Tail nodes of the Pipeline.

#### Team-level execution metrics

An administrator will have the option to create the following tables at the time of team creation which are used for storing [Execution Metrics](docs/low-code-spark/execution/execution-metrics.md). The administrator will grant access to the tables accordingly to their team members.

- Pipeline Metrics Table
- Component (Dataset) Metrics Table
- Interim Table

#### Seamless Git Integration with stored credentials

Added the ability to store [Git](docs/metadata/git.md) credentials. The credentials can be shared among projects without re-authenticating.

#### Streaming Pipeline Support (_Beta_)

With this release, Prophecy now support Streaming Pipelines. User can now read data from streaming sources, apply transformations and save it to streaming Targets.

### Updates

#### Union By Name

Added Union by name in [Set Operations](docs/low-code-spark/gems/transform/set-operation.md) Gem. This can be used now to get union by column names when positions are different in two datasets.

### Improvements

#### IDE disconnection issue

Some users were frequently seeing IDE disconnected errors in UI. This used to happen if user is still on UI but not doing any operations. Added handling of pong messages to fix the behaviour.

#### Python code generation taking long time

For big schema's, Prophecy's Python optimiser was taking significant time due to which compilation was delayed.
The new optimization speeds up wide table processing on the UI layer by adding pre-optimization phases. This will try to eagerly evaluate and substitute for preconfigured syntax.  
The compilation time reduced from order of seconds to milliseconds.

#### Blocked log4j dependency

The Scala maven plugin has a log4j dependency that is blocked for some customers. Updated the log4j dependency.

## 2.7.0.0 (February 16 2023)

- Prophecy Python libs version: 1.4.0
- Prophecy Scala libs version: 7.0.6

### Behaviour Changes

#### Spark and Scala Versions are now Required in Livy Fabrics

For creating a Livy Fabric, previously the Spark and Scala versions were optional and had default values 2.3.0 and 2.11. With this release these fields are made mandatory, and users will need to update their Fabric configurations with respective Spark and Scala version values. Please refer [here](../concepts/fabrics/create-a-fabric#livy) for more details.

### New Features {#2700}

#### Kafka and Watermarking support (_Beta_)

With this release, we have added support for Kafka as a streaming Source and Target. Also support for Watermarking is added in all streaming Gems.

#### Data Fabric ACL

Support for Data Fabric authorization is added with this release. This feature allows administrators within a team to assign proper access to its team members. For example, only a teamâ€™s administrator can perform tasks such as creation and deletion of Data Fabrics.

#### Ticketing Support

Users can raise Support tickets, Feature requests, and bugs using the following two options:

- Within the Prophecy UI by clicking on the Support icon in the Bottom-left corner.

### UX improvements

#### Auto Connect Gems and Auto suggest on Drag and drop

While adding new Gems to a Pipeline, the input of new Gem will be Auto-Connected to the output node when dragged closer to existing Gems.

Also, when dragging a Gem on canvas, user will be auto-suggested a Gem position. Please see the below examples.

User can hold Shift key to disable this.

#### Zoom-in And Zoom-out

Users can now use Two-fingers-Pinch to zoom-in or zoom-out on the Pipeline canvas.

#### Gem Sorting

All the Gems listed in the Gems drawer are now sorted Alphabetically for easy lookup.

#### Dangling interims

While editing/creating Pipeline, when user haven't yet added a target Gem, they will be able to see Dangling interims for the tail nodes.

### Improvements {#2700}

#### Project creation on protected main branches

Now users will be able to create projects when using Repositories with protected main Branches. This is applicable for both Single-fork or Multi-fork Repositories.

#### IDE disconnection Error handling

When a user is on Pipeline IDE, the connection to Prophecy backend can be lost due to multiple reasons and accordingly users will see below Error Handling scenarios:

- If connection is lost due to inactivity (Probably user switched to another tab), then they will see a reconnecting toast as shown below:
  ![IDE_disconnect1](img/ide_disconnect1.png)
- When your device network is switched
  ![IDE_disconnect2](img/ide_disconnect3.png)
- When some other unknown disconnection happens (For example: the network provider switched at router level)
