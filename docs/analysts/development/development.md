Prophecy makes it easy to extract insights from data to support decision-making. It does so by bridging the gap between data engineering and analysisâ€”all in one platform.

## Generate pipelines with Copilot

Before you can start analyzing your data, you need to make sure that the data is collected, stored, and transformed into a usable format. While this traditionally falls to data engineers, anyone can use Prophecy to convert business specifications into pipelines.

Whether you create a pipeline through the intuitive visual interface or use Copilot to automatically generate pipelines, Prophecy will compile it into production-ready code that can be refined and validated by data engineers.

## Prepare and transform data

Once you have reliable and structured data, you can start preparing and transforming that data for analysis. Begin with a Prophecy project, where you can build and schedule your own data pipelines using components like gems, datasets, and jobs.

## Leverage business applications

To further improve collaboration between data engineers and analysts, business applications can be used to package complex pipelines into easy-to-use applications for non-technical users.

## Powered by SQL

Data analysis projects are powered by SQL and dbt. Prophecy compiles visually-developed pipelines into SQL code that (while already optimized by Prophecy) can be further refined by engineers who understand specific warehouse specifications.
