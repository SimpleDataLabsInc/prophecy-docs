## Features

The following features are available in this release.

- You can now use Google BigQuery as a SQL Warehouse connection in Prophecy fabrics. This means that you can run SQL transformations in pipelines in your BigQuery warehouse.

  Learn how to configure a [BigQuery connection](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/connections/bigquery).

- PySpark project pipelines can now run on Databricks serverless compute.

  See supported features and limitations in [Databricks serverless compute for PySpark](/administration/fabrics/Spark-fabrics/databricks/databricks-serverless).

- You can now define and call [stored procedures](/analysts/stored-procedure) within SQL projects running on BigQuery. This is particularly useful when migrating workflows from other systems.

- Pipeline schedules can now be triggered by [file arrivals or changes](/analysts/triggers#file-arrival-or-change-trigger) in a specified SFTP or S3 location.

- Prophecy provides the following new gems in this release.

  - [Pivot](/analysts/pivot) (SQL):Reshape your data by transforming unique row values from one column into new columns.

  - [Unpivot](/analysts/unpivot) (SQL): Convert multiple columns into row-level key-value pairs to simplify columnar data.

## Enhancements

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- We have improved the release flow for protected branches. When a branch like `main` is protected, direct commits to it are not allowed. Our previous release process required a direct commit to `main`, which caused issues in these scenarios. We now provide an option on the Open Pull Request screen to bump the version of the source branch before merging into main. To learn more, visit [Pull requests](/engineers/git-pull-requests).

- You can now merge from the default branch (e.g., `main`) into another branch. Previously, the merge UI only allowed merging into the default branch. This enhancement is available in both the [Git workflow dialog](/engineers/git-workflow) within the project editor and the Commits tab on the [project metadata](/projects#metadata) page.

- We now support uploading [Parquet](/analysts/parquet) files to Databricks connections.

- You can now enable auditing for file downloads from Prophecy. When this feature is turned on via an environment flag, audit logs will capture the file name, the user who downloaded it, and the page in Prophecy where the download occurred. Contact your administrator or support team to enable this feature.

## Fixes

The following fix is available in this release.

- The [TableIterator](/engineers/table-iterator/) gem now works with [Selective](/engineers/data-sampling) data sampling mode.

## Prophecy Library versions

The following are the newest available Prophecy Library versions in this release.

- ProphecyLibsPython 2.0.0

- ProphecyLibsScala 8.10.1
