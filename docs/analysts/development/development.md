<h3><span class="badge">SQL</span></h3>

Prophecy makes it easy to extract insights from data to support decision-making. It does so by bridging the gap between data engineering and analysisâ€”all in one platform.

## Generate pipelines with Copilot

Before you can start analyzing your data, you need to make sure that the data is collected, stored, and transformed into a usable format. While this traditionally falls to data engineers, anyone can use Prophecy to convert business specifications into pipelines.

Whether you create a pipeline through the intuitive visual interface or use Copilot to automatically generate pipelines, Prophecy will compile it into production-ready code that can be refined and validated by data engineers.

## Prepare and transform data

Once you have reliable and structured data, you can start preparing and transforming that data for analysis. Begin with a Prophecy project, where you can build and schedule your own data pipelines using components like gems, tables, and functions.

## Leverage business applications

To further improve collaboration between data engineers and analysts, business applications can be used to package complex pipelines into easy-to-use applications for non-technical users.

## Powered by SQL

Pipelines developed in SQL projects use the Prophecy runtime and a SQL warehouse connection for computation.

Within a pipeline, data transformations are powered by SQL and dbt. These transformations are compiled into SQL code that (while already optimized by Prophecy) can be further refined by engineers who understand SQL model optimization.
