## Features

The following are features and improvements available in this release.

- SQL UDFs stored in Databricks Unity Catalog are [now available for use](../../Spark/functions/user-defined-functions.md#import-udfs) in Prophecy **Python** Projects.

- There are now three ways to upload a file and incorporate it into your Spark pipeline:

  - Drag and drop the file directly onto the pipeline canvas.

  - Open the Source/Target gem drawer and click **Upload file**.

  - Create a new Source gem, click **+ New Dataset**, and then select **Upload file**.

- When SCIM is enabled, there is a new option under **Settings > SSO** that lets you easily generate a SCIM token.

- We now offer M2M functionality with [Databricks OAuth](docs/administration/authentication/databricks-oauth.md) for scheduled job and deployment authentication. Visit the Databricks documentation to learn more about [access to Databricks with a Service Principal using OAuth](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html).
