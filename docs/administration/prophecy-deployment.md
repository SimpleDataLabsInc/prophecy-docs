Prophecy runs on a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud. The cloud architecture depends on the Prophecy deployment type.

## Deployment types

Prophecy supports SaaS (multi-tenant) and Dedicated SaaS (single-tenant) deployments.

### SaaS

The SaaS deployment option is entirely Prophecy-managed and has a multi-tenant architecture. SaaS provides the fastest access to latest features. Try out Prophecy using our SaaS environment by signing up for a [free trial](https://app.prophecy.io/metadata/auth/signup).

### Dedicated SaaS

Like our SaaS deployment, the Dedicated SaaS deployment is Prophecy-managed. However, Dedicated SaaS provides the convenience of a Prophecy-managed environment, but also the privacy of an isolated space on Prophecyâ€™s Virtual Private Cloud. This is also known as a single-tenant architecture.

You can choose your preferred cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP), and Prophecy will manage installation, maintenance, resource allocation, and more.
