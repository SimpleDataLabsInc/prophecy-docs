In Prophecy, execution refers to running a set of defined operations in a data pipeline.

## Fabrics

Fabrics define the execution environment of your pipeline. This refers to where the computation happens.

## Interactive execution

Prophecy lets you run your pipeline interactively during development

## Job execution

When you schedule a job, you must define where that job will run.
