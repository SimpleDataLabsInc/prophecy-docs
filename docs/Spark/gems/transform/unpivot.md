Use the Unpivot gem to transform your data from a wide format to a long format.

:::note

If you want to pivot the data, rather than unpivot, use the [Aggregate](/engineers/aggregate) gem.

## Parameters

| Parameter                       | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Column(s) to use as identifiers | The column(s) that will identify to which group or entity the observation corresponds to.                                    |
| Columns to unpivot              | The columns (wide format) that you would like to transform into a single column (long format).                               |
| Variable column name            | The name of the column that contains the names of the unpivoted columns. This helps describe the values in the value column. |
| Value column name               | The name of the column that will contain the values from the unpivoted columns.                                              |

## Example

Imagine you have sales data for different products, with each quarter's sales stored in its own columnâ€”this is known as wide format. Before modeling seasonal trends or doing time series analysis, it's often helpful to convert this into long format, where each row represents a single observation.

<div class="table-example">

| Product | Q1  | Q2  | Q3  | Q4  |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A       | 100 | 150 | 130 | 170 |
| B       | 90  | 120 | 110 | 160 |

</div>

To configure a Unpivot gem for this table:

1. Select the identifier columns. In the example above, the `Product` column is the identifier column.
1. Select the columns to unpivot. In the example above, all of the quarter columns (`Q1`, `Q2`, etc.) are your columns to unpivot.
1. Name the variable column `Quarter` because it identifies the sales period.
1. Name the value column `UnitsSold` because it contains number of units sold per quarter.
1. Save and run the gem.

After the transformation:

- The quarter names (`Q1`, `Q2`, etc.) will move into a new `Quarter` column.
- The corresponding sales values will be stored in a `UnitsSold` column.

<div class="table-example">

| Product | Quarter | UnitsSold |
| ------- | ------- | --------- |
| A       | Q1      | 100       |
| A       | Q2      | 150       |
| A       | Q3      | 130       |
| A       | Q4      | 170       |
| B       | Q1      | 90        |
| B       | Q2      | 120       |
| B       | Q3      | 110       |
| B       | Q4      | 160       |

</div>

This makes your data easier to analyze over time, since each row now represents one product's sales for a specific quarter.
