## Features

### Expanded business rules capabilities

The new [business rule](docs/Spark/functions/business-rules-engine/business-rules-engine.md) capabilities include:

- Setting a timeframe in which business rules should apply.
- Automatic detection of conflicting rule logic.
- Defining multiple output columns per business rule.

## Updates

### New function to enable custom schema by default for custom gems

When you are building a custom gem, you can include the `customOutputSchemaEnabled` function in your gem code to enable or disable to **Custom Schema** toggle by default. This toggle can be found in the **Output** tab of a gem.

### Advanced mode available when defining a target model location

When you want to [overwrite the default database](docs/SQL/gems/target-models/location.md) for your target model, you can now use **advanced mode** to dynamically populate the field. Rather than inputting a simple string, you can now use functions, values, and variables in your database definition.

### Enhanced experience when viewing interim data samples

## Fixes

### Improved performance of gems on UC shared clusters
