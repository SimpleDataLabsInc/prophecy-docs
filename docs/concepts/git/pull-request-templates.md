Prophecy supports opening pull requests on your external Git provider to merge
development branches to a base branch on a remote repository.

:::note
You will not see this option if using Prophecy-managed Git for your project.
:::

## Enable Pull Request Template

To enable pull requests:

1. Open your project metadata.
1. Open the **Settings** tab.
1. Next to **Pull Request Template**, toggle on the **Enabled** button.
1. Review the template URL.

The PR template URL requires two variables which are used to build a URL string. The `{{source}}` variable represents the active development branch, and the `{{destination}}` variable represents the base branch to which the development branches need to be merged to, like `main`.

:::info
The template URL will be automatically generated depending on your configured external Git provider. This auto-generation is
currently being done for GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, Gitlab, Gitlab Enterprise, BitBucket, and Azure Devops repositories. You can also edit the autogenerated templates.
:::

Example template for a GitHub repository:

```shell
https://github.com/exampleOrg/exampleRepo/compare/{{destination}}...{{source}}?expand=1
```

An example pull request URL generated from the above template for merging a branch named `feature`
to branch `main` would look like:

```shell
https://github.com/exampleOrg/exampleRepo/compare/main...feature?expand=1
```

## Open Pull Request

If the pull request template is configured correctly and enabled, you can open a pull request during the **Merge** step of the Git process.

When you open a pull request from the Prophecy interface, Prophecy will redirect you to your external Git provider based on the template defined in the project **Settings** tab.
