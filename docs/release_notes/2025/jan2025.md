#### Databricks OAuth integration improvements

We've added a section to the Admin > Security page for the Prophecy Team Admin to configure the Client Id and Client Secret in order to be enable all users on their Prophecy instance to use Databricks OAuth authentication.

Also, when configuring a Job for SQL, the the Service Principal specified during Fabric creation will be used instead of the user specified under Run As.

For more information, see [Databricks OAuth](../../architecture/self-hosted/authentication/databricks-oauth.md).

#### Additional service APIs

You can use APIs to perform the following tasks:

- Configure LDAP group
- Run services
- Request software version

For more information on the APIs, see [Teams and Users](../../concepts/teamuser.md).
