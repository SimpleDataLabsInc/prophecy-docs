## Features

### Enhanced Data Explorer experience

The [Data Explorer](docs/Spark/execution/data-explorer.md) has been enhanced in the following ways:

- Filter and sort happen in the frontend. It no longer requires execution in the backend.
- You can search your data using the new **Search** function.
- You can load larger data samples at a time using the new **Selective** data sampling setting.

## Updates

### Snowflake for Prophecy-managed Airflow

We now support Snowflake as a connection on our Prophecy-managed Airflow fabric.

### Data sampling settings restriction

To change role restrictions for fabric-level [data sampling settings](docs/Spark/execution/interactive-execution.md), we have introduced two new flags that you can enable on your Prophecy deployment.

- `ALLOW_FABRIC_ACCESS_CLUSTER_ADMIN`: Grants cluster admins full access to fabrics, even if they are not team admins.
- `DISALLOW_FABRIC_CODEDEPS_UPDATE_TEAM_ADMIN`: Prevents team admins from modifying the data sampling settings within a fabric.

## Fixes

### Single user clusters used by a Databricks group

Users in Databricks groups assigned to single user clusters will have the permission to attach to the cluster in Prophecy without any further action.
