Prophecy helps you develop data pipelines in high-quality Spark or SQL codeâ€”but what does Prophecy use to compute these pipelines? The first thing to understand before building any pipeline is that your pipeline must be connected to an **execution environment**.

This is why **fabrics** exist in Prophecy. Fabrics let Prophecy connect to specific execution environments and data storage.

## Fabric types

Different fabrics are designed to support specific project types. Use the table below to identify which fabric best aligns with your project's execution requirements.

| Fabric type                                            | Description                                           | Usage                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Prophecy](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/)  | Compute with the Prophecy runtime and a SQL warehouse | Run [pipelines](docs/analysts/development/pipelines/pipelines.md) in SQL projects.                |
| [Spark](/administration/fabrics/Spark-fabrics/Fabrics) | Compute with a Spark engine                           | Run [pipelines](docs/Spark/pipelines/pipelines.md) in PySpark/Scala projects and Databricks jobs. |
| [SQL](/administration/fabrics/sql-fabrics/Fabrics)     | Compute with a SQL warehouse                          | Run [models](docs/data-modeling/data-modeling.md) in SQL projects. You cannot run pipelines.      |
| [Airflow](/Orchestration/airflow/)                     | Compute with an Airflow-compatible engine             | Run [Airflow](docs/Orchestration/airflow/airflow.md) jobs.                                        |

## Use case

Here is one way you might set up your fabrics. First, the team admin creates:

- A team named Marketing_DSS for the Marketing Decision Support System users.
- A `dev` fabric for development activities that specifies the Marketing_DSS team.
- A `prod` fabric for production pipelines that specifies the Marketing_DSS team.

In this example, all users in the Marketing_DSS Team will have access to the `dev` and `prod` fabrics.

## Components

Fabrics include everything required to run a data pipeline. Because different execution environments are built differently, each fabric will require a unique configuration. You can find these requirements in the [administration](docs/administration/index.md) section of the documentation. Usually a team admin will create and configure fabrics for their team. The table below describes components at a high level.

| Component             | Description                                                                                                         | Required                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials           | Prophecy securely encrypts your credentials and uses them to connect to your external environments.                 | Credentials are required to establish connections to external execution environments.                                                                               |
| Cluster configuration | This will determine the computation resources allocated to you.                                                     | Cluster configurations are required. Defaults are pre-configured based on your credentials.                                                                         |
| Connections           | To connect to multiple data providers for use in your pipelines, you can add additional connections to your fabric. | One connection to a primary execution environment is required. Additional connections are optional.                                                                 |
| Secrets               | Fabrics can store secrets from different secret providers such as HashiCorp Vault.                                  | Secrets are not required for fabric creation. However, sometimes secrets are required for connections. If a secret is required, you will be prompted to create one. |

[Team admins](docs/administration/teams-users/teamuser.md) typically set up fabrics. Detailed steps for fabric creation can be found in the [fabrics](docs/administration/fabrics.md) section of the documentation.

:::info
Prophecy provides a trial Prophecy-managed fabric that can get you started with building your pipelines. However, you will need to connect to external execution environments for your production workflows.

## Fabric usage

To execute your pipelines, you must attach a fabric to your project, as fabrics define the project's execution environment. You can switch between different fabrics within a project based on factors such as whether you want to use a development or production execution environment. All fabrics created for your teams will be available for you to view and use.

To attach a fabric to a project:

1. Open a project from the Prophecy metadata page.
1. Open a pipeline or model that you want to work on.
1. Expand the **Attach Cluster** menu. This menu will differ slightly between Spark and SQL projects.
1. Select a fabric. You will be shown fabrics that have the same data provider as your project (e.g., Databricks).
1. Attach to a cluster or create a new cluster.
1. Run your pipeline or model. This executes the data transformation on the environment defined in the fabric!

:::note
Even though teams share fabrics, **each user must add their individual credentials** to be able to use the fabric in their projects.

## Fabric metadata

A list of all fabrics available to you can be found in the **Fabrics** tab of the **Metadata** page.

![Fabric Metadata](./img/fabric_metadata_1.png)

You can click into each fabric to access the fabric settings. These will resemble the settings that appear during fabric creation.
