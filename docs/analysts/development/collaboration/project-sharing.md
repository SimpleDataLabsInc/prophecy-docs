Share your Prophecy projects with team members or external stakeholders. You can grant full editing access through team membership or provide read-only access via public links.

## Share with your team

Grant project access by adding users to the team that owns the project. Team members can view and edit all projects owned by their team.

### Add users from the project

## Share publicly

:::edition Free and Professional
Public sharing is available in [Free and Professional Editions](/getting-started/editions/) only.
:::

Share your project with anyone using a public link. This provides read-only access without requiring authentication, making it ideal for demos, documentation, or stakeholder reviews.

:::caution Data visibility
Public links expose metadata from your fabric, including schema names, table lists, connection details, and data previews. Only share projects publicly when this information can be safely disclosed.
:::

### Enable public sharing

To create a public share link:

1. Open the version control menu in the top right corner of the project editor.
1. Select **Share Project & Replays**. This opens the sharing dialog.
1. Click on the **Public Share** tab.
1. Choose your sharing method:

   - Copy the link to share manually
   - Enter email addresses to send the link automatically

To revoke public access, change the **Anyone on the internet with the link** dropdown to **No access**.

### Read-only capabilities

Users with the public link can:

- View pipeline structure and gem configurations
- Run pipelines and see execution results
- Inspect interim data samples between pipeline steps
- Use the AI agent to ask questions about data and logic

Users cannot:

- Edit pipeline components or configurations
- Use the AI agent to modify the pipeline

### Cloning shared projects

If a viewer clicks **Edit** while in read-only mode:

1. They're prompted to log in (if not authenticated).
2. A **Clone Project to Edit** dialog appears.
3. Clicking **Clone Now** creates a copy of the project in their personal team.
4. They must reconfigure all Source, Target, and Table gems to point to their own fabric resources (unless they have access to the original fabric through team membership).
