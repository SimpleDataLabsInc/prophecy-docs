App settings control how your Prophecy App behaves during development and runtime. These settings are available in the App Builder.

## Enable Auto Run

When Auto Run is enabled:

- The app will automatically run as you build it, showing live previews of data, charts, and outputs.
- The app will also auto-run when an end user opens it, so results load instantly without needing to click the play button.

Turn this off if you want to manually control when your app executes.
