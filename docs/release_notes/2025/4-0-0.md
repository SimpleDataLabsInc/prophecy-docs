## Features

### Prophecy for Analysts

This major release introduces **Prophecy for Analysts**, a set of completely new capabilities in the platform tailored for business users. The following features are only available for projects that leverage [Prophecy fabrics](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/). In this release, we introduce:

- [Prophecy fabrics](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/) that accommodate native orchestration with [Prophecy Automate](/administration/architecture).

- [Connections](/analysts/connections) to a wide variety of data providers that can be used throughout pipelines and shared with teammates.

- [Business applications](/analysts/business-applications) that enable non-technical users to run pipelines with built-in guardrails.

- [A new set of gems](/analysts/gems) that allow you to ingest, transform, parse, clean, and write data in the visual pipeline canvas.

- [Simplified versioning](/analysts/versioning) to streamline your project workflow, while still following Git best practices.

- [Monitoring](/analysts/monitoring) in the Observability page for tracking deployed projects and pipeline schedules.

- [Data profiling](/analysts/data-explorer) in the Data Explorer for quick statistics on your data.

- [Collaboration capabilities](/analysts/collaboration) to bridge the gap between teams and speed up time to production.

- [Extensibility features](/analysts/extensibility) that let you build custom components for projects and add additional functionality to Prophecy.

### Prophecy for Engineers

For this release, we have developed the following new features for Spark projects:

- [Data profiling](/engineers/data-profile) in the Data Explorer for quick statistics on your data.

- [Data diff](/engineers/data-diff) lets you see if your target data at the end of your pipeline matches your expectations.

## Updates

  - Run the [CSV Source gem](/engineers/csv) on a UC standard cluster by reading the file with Pandas as of `ProphecySparkBasicsPython==0.2.44`.

  - Run the [BigQuery Source gem](/engineers/bigquery) on a UC standard cluster when you upgrade to `ProphecyWarehousePython==0.0.9`.

  - Run the EmailData gem on a UC standard cluster when you upgrade to `ProphecyWebAppPython==0.1.2`.

  - Run the [Seed Source gem](engineers/seed) on a UC standard cluster when you upgrade to `ProphecySparkBasicsPython==0.2.39`.
