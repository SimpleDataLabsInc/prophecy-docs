Each page below describes one of the set of Gems that prepare or use data for Machine Learning. These Gems have a required [Cluster library dependency](/docs/low-code-spark/gems/machine-learning/machine-learning.md#cluster-library-dependencies). For an example set of Pipelines that use these Gems to create a Generative AI Chatbot, see this [guide.](/docs/getting-started/genaichatbot.md)

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

### Cluster library dependencies

Required:

1. [**Spark-AI**](https://github.com/prophecy-io/spark-ai/tree/main) - Toolbox for building Generative AI applications on top of Apache Spark. Click [here](https://github.com/prophecy-io/spark-ai/tree/main#roadmap) to see the roadmap for what's coming in the future with the Spark-AI toolbox.
