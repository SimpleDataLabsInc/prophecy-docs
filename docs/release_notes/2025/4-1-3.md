## Prophecy for Analysts

### Features {#analyst-features}

The following features are available in this release.

- The new Pipeline gem lets you trigger other pipelines in the same project.

### Enhancements {#analyst-enhancements}

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- Divide your pipeline into logical sections using the newly added [visual containers](/analysts/containers) for canvas organization.

- You can now enable or disable [auto-run](/analysts/app-settings) for Prophecy Apps in the app settings.

## Prophecy for Engineers

### Features {#engineer-features}

The following features are available in this release.

- You can now define [project-level configurations](/engineers/configurations) that are shared across all pipelines within a project.

### Enhancements {#engineer-enhancements}

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- Prophecy can now capture [execution metrics](/engineers/execution-metrics/) for pipelines that run using Selective [data sampling](/engineers/data-sampling) mode.

- The **Vanilla** [data sampling](/engineers/data-sampling) mode has been removed from the UI. Pipelines that currently use Vanilla will continue to run as expected; however, once the sampling mode is changed, you wonâ€™t be able to switch back to Vanilla. We recommend updating all pipelines from Vanilla to Selective mode.
