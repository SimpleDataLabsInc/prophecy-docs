**Prophecy-built-tool** (PBT) allows you to quickly build projects generated by Prophecy (your standard Spark Scala and
PySpark Pipelines) to integrate with your own CI / CD (e.g. Github Actions), build system (e.g. Jenkins), and
orchestration (e.g. Databricks Workflows).

## Features (v1.0.1)

- Build and unit test all Pipelines in Prophecy projects (Scala and Python)
- Deploy Jobs with built Pipelines on Databricks
- Integrate with CI/CD tools like Github Actions
- Verify the project structure of Prophecy projects

## Requirements

- Python >=3.6
- pip

## Installation

To install PBT, simply run:

```
pip3 install prophecy-build-tool
```

## Quickstart

### Usage

```shell
Usage: pbt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build
  deploy
  test
```

### Running locally

The PBT cli can be used to build, test and deploy projects created by Prophecy that are present in your local filesystem.

Please make sure the **DATABRICKS_URL** and **DATABRICKS_TOKEN** environment variables are set appropriately pointing to your Databricks workspace before running any PBT commands.
Example:

```shell
export DATABRICKS_HOST="https://example_databricks_host.cloud.databricks.com"
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="exampledatabrickstoken"
```

#### Building Pipelines and deploying Jobs

```shell
pbt deploy --path /path/to/your/prophecy_project/
```

Sample output:

```shell
Prophecy-build-tool v1.0.1

Found 1 jobs: daily
Found 1 pipelines: customers_orders (python)

Querying existing jobs to find current job: Offset: 0, Pagesize: 25
    Updating an existing job: daily

✅ Deployment completed successfully!
```

#### Running all unit tests in project

Running unit tests requires **FABRIC_NAME** environment variable to be set. Example:

```shell
export FABRIC_NAME="dev"
```

This will be used to pick the correct configuration for running the unit tests.

```shell
pbt test --path /path/to/your/prophecy_project/
```

Sample output:

```shell
Prophecy-build-tool v1.0.1

Found 1 jobs: daily
Found 1 pipelines: customers_orders (python)

## Integrating with Github actions

PBT can be integrated with your own CI/CD solution to build, test and deploy Prophecy code. The steps for setting up PBT with Github Actions on your repository containing a Prophecy project is mentioned below.

### Pre-requisite

- A Prophecy project that is currently hosted in a Github repository

### Setting up environment variables and secrets

PBT requires environment variables **DATABRICKS_URL, DATABRICKS_TOKEN** and **FABRIC_NAME** to be set for complete functionality.
Setting **DATABRICKS_TOKEN** as a secret in Github
The **DATABRICKS_TOKEN** that needs to be used can be set as a secret inside the Github repository of the project.
Steps:

- Go to Settings > Secrets > Actions from the repository menu
- Click ‘New Repository secret’
- Add the secret with name DATABRICKS_TOKEN and value of the Databricks token to be used by PBT.

Screenshot after setting DATABRICKS_TOKEN secret:

The environment variables can now be all set within the Github actions YML file as follows:

```yaml
env:
  DATABRICKS_HOST: "https://sample_databricks_url.cloud.databricks.com"
  DATABRICKS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DATABRICKS_TOKEN }}
  FABRIC_NAME: "dev"
```

### Setting up a Github Actions Workflow on every push to main branch

We’re now ready to setup CI/CD on the Prophecy project.
To setup a workflow to build, run all unit tests and then deploy the built jar (Scala)/ whl (Python) on Databricks on every push to the main automatically:

- Create a .YML file in the project repository at the below location (relative to root)

```
.github/workflows/exampleWorkflow.yml
```

- Add the below contents to **exampleWorkflow.yml**

```yaml
name: Example CI/CD with Github actions

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

env:
  DATABRICKS_HOST: "https://sample_databricks_url.cloud.databricks.com"
  DATABRICKS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DATABRICKS_TOKEN }}
  FABRIC_NAME: "dev"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: "11"
          distribution: "adopt"
      - name: Set up Python 3.x
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.x"
      # Install all python dependencies
      # prophecy-libs not included here because prophecy-build-tool takes care of it by reading each pipeline's setup.py
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip3 install build pytest wheel pytest-html pyspark  prophecy-build-tool
      - name: Run PBT build
        run: pbt build --path .
      - name: Run PBT test
        run: pbt test --path .
      - name: Run PBT deploy
        run: pbt deploy --path .
```

The above workflow does the following in order:

1. Triggers on every change that is pushed to the branch ‘main’
2. Sets the environment variables required for PBT to run: DATABRICKS_HOST, DATABRICKS_TOKEN and FABRIC_NAME
3. Sets up JDK 11, Python 3 and other dependencies required for PBT to run
4. Builds all the Pipelines present in the project and generates a .jar/.whl file. If the build fails at any point a non-zero exit code is returned which stops the workflow from proceeding further and the workflow run is marked as a failure.
5. Runs all the unit tests present in the project using FABRIC_NAME as the configuration. If any of the unit test fails a non-zero exit code is returned which stops the workflow from proceeding further and the workflow run is marked as a failure.
6. Deploys the built .jar/.whl to the Databricks location mentioned in `databricks-job.json` mentioned in the `jobs` directory of the project. If the Job already exists in Databricks it is updated with the new .jar/.whl. If this process fails at any step, a non-zero exit code is returned which stops the workflow from proceeding further and the workflow run is marked as a failure.
