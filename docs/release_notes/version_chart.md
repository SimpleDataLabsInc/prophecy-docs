This version chart shows which versions of our standard Prophecy Scala Libraries and Prophecy Python Libraries should be
used with any given version of the Prophecy product. In general Prophecy strives to be backwards compatible, so
older sets of Prophecy Libs should be able to run on a newer version of Prophecy.

:::caution
Always keep in mind to make sure the Spark version and Scala version of your Prophecy Scala Libs match the Spark and
Scala versions of your cluster!
