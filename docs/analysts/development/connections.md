## External sources and targets

When you set up an external Source or Target gem, you will have to choose a connection for that gem. You can create a new one if needed:

1. Click **Add Connection**.

## Environment tab

Sometimes, you don't know the exact file path of your external data. This is why Prophecy lets you **browse data** in the Environment tab of your project.

1. **Add connections.** The data you see in the Environment tab of your project depends on the [Connections](docs/administration/prophecy-fabrics/connections/connections.md) you have set up in your attached fabric. You can add a connection by clicking on the button at the bottom of the Environment tab.
1. **View data.** Expand each connection to see the different tables that are available in that fabric. What you will see depends on the connection type and your user permissions for that connection.
1. **Add data**. When you click **Add** next to a table, a new fully-configured Source gem will appear on your project canvas.
