When you build projects in Prophecy, you can save and publish your work with the click of a button. Prophecy will maintain a linear version history for you, from which you can audit changes, see collaborator activity, and revert to previous versions.

## Save your progress

As you develop your project, Prophecy automatically preserves your changes. However, you should periodically save your changes in logical stages.

## Project publication

Prophecy lets you publish your projects

## Version history

The version history in Prophecy tracks different versions of your project that you save and publish.

## Git in the backend

Versioning in Prophecy is built on top of [Git](docs/ci-cd/git/git.md) in the backend. This means that your project is hosted on and tracked in a Git repository. If you want to connect your external Git provider for project hosting, you can do so. That way, you can also view your version history in Git and follow your organization's Git workflow requirements.
