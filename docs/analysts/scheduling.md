If you want to schedule pipeline runs, you can do so right in your project canvas.

## Schedule pipeline

A schedule requires the following parameters.

| Parameter              | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency              | How often the pipeline will run                                                   |
| Repeat at              | The time that the pipeline will run                                               |
| Timezone               | The timezone of **Repeat at** time                                                |
| Alerts on the full job | Enable to send an email on the start, success, and/or failure of the pipeline run |

Once the schedule is created, you'll be able to view the frequency at the top right corner of the pipeline canvas.

## Publish project

Your schedule will not be enacted until you publish your project.
