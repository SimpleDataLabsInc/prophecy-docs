## Prophecy for Analysts

### Features {#analyst-features}

The following features are available in this release.

- We have released two new editions of Prophecy for analysts: Free and Professional Edition. Free and Professional Editions are designed for data analysts who want to collaborate without managing infrastructure. Both editions provide Prophecy-managed resources that are metered by credits.

  Review the [Prophecy Editions](docs/getting-started/editions/editions.md) page for a full comparison between Free, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Prophecy.

- You can now use Prophecy's AI Agent to [generate pipeline documentation](docs/analysts/development/ai-agent/ai-documentation.md). Instead of writing documentation manually, this lets you create detailed specifications automatically.

- Prophecy provides the following new gems in this release.

  - [Regex](/analysts/regex): Enables pattern matching and text extraction using regular expressions.
  - [GCS Source and Target](/analysts/gcs-gem): Read from or write to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets.
  - [Salesforce Target](/analysts/salesforce): Supports writing to Salesforce Objects (CRM Analytics datasets not supported for targets).

### Enhancements {#analyst-enhancements}

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- The [Email gem](/analysts/email) now supports a **Use column** option for several parameters, including **To**, **Cc**, **Bc**, **Subject**, and **Body**. When enabled, these fields can be dynamically populated from columns in your input dataset. Each row in your dataset can specify a different recipient and/or custom message while sending the same attachment to all recipients.

- The [RestAPI gem](/analysts/rest-api) now supports parsing JSON responses into multiple output columns.

- XLSX (Excel) Source and Target gems have been enhanced:

  - Read from multiple sheets in a single Excel file and union all rows into one output table.
  - Write to multiple sheets by providing a column whose values are target sheet names. Sheets are created if they donâ€™t exist.

- We have added an option to the [Directory gem](/analysts/directory) that enables you to list all the sheet names in XLSX files detected in a specified directory.

- You can now use the [DynamicInput gem](/analysts/dynamic-input) to union data from files defined in a column of file paths. Schemas are matched based on column names.

## Prophecy for Engineers
