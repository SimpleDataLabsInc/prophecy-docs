### Updates {#UpdatesRelease290}

#### Sharable Subgraphs and UDFs

Some key practices during Data-Project development is _Create standards for development_, such as the standard visual components (Or UDFs and Subgraphs) to be used in the low-code platform for encryption
and anonymization of the data, and publish these standard to the domain teams.

Data admins also _Create deployment templates for the pipelines_ that have the best practices baked into them for authorization, for notifications and
handling of errors and logging the correct information.
Prophecy has now enabled the Data platform teams to create and **Publish** these standards to the various teams.
User can now use the UDFs,Subgraphs,Datasets and Pipelines defined in one Project/Pipeline, in all Pipelines of the Project and also other Projects.

:::info
Please note, Users will see new Uncommitted changes in their Pipelines when they open it. They can see UDFs code being added to all Pipelines, Configs added to Subgraphs, etc.
