Prophecy makes it easy to extract insights from data to support decision-making. It does so by bridging the gap between data engineering and analysisâ€”all in one platform.

Review the pipeline development section of the docs to learn about:

- **Building pipelines.** Use the project and pipeline interface in the Prophecy development environment.
- **Copilot functionality.** Interact with Copilot to automatically generate full pipelines or pipeline components.
- **Available gems.** View all of the available components that you can drag onto your canvas and arrange into a pipeline.
- **Data exploration.** Generate data samples through the pipeline to understand what your data looks like at each stage.
- **Data connections.** Create connections to external data providers so you can leverage that data natively in Prophecy.
- **Writing functions.** Extend your project functionality by building functions that can be used in gems.
- **Data tests.** Ensure that your business data is generated reliably over time.
- **Collaboration.** Understand how to best work with teammates on your projects and pipelines.
