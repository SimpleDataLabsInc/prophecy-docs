#### Config Variable Value Updates in Scala

In this latest release, we've introduced a new pipeline setting that allows users to modify or override configuration variable values in Scala using Script gems. Previously, this feature was available for Python projects and is now extended to Scala projects. By default, this setting is enabled for all new pipelines. To enable it for existing pipelines, simply set the Allow Configuration Update flag to true, as demonstrated below.

### Features {#FeaturesRelease321}

#### Advance Settings for Releases and Deployments

In this latest update, we are introducing advanced settings for releases and deployments to empower Project Admins with finer control.
Regular project releases handle the deployment of pipelines, gems, and jobs to designated environments.
With this enhancement, users have the flexibility to redeploy previously created release versions and opt to deploy specific jobs during the deployment process. These capabilities, among others, are now easily accessible through the Prophecy UI.

For more details on these exciting features, please refer to the [documentation](/engineers/deployment).
