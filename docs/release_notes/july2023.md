- Prophecy Scala libs version: 7.0.50

### Features {#UpdatesRelease311}

#### Conditional Execution In Spark Pipelines

We are thrilled to announce the addition of support for conditional execution in Spark Gems within our Pipeline framework. This highly anticipated feature provides users with the ability to effortlessly build conditional transformation scenarios directly on our user interface (UI).

With this update, users can now incorporate pass-through or removal conditions within a Gem, offering greater control and flexibility over data transformations. Conditional execution allows users to define specific criteria or rules that determine whether a particular transformation should be applied or skipped during Pipeline execution.
By leveraging conditional execution, users can easily implement complex data processing logic and dynamically adapt their Pipelines based on varying conditions. This empowers users to efficiently handle different scenarios, such as filtering out irrelevant data, applying specific transformations based on business rules, or performing conditional aggregations.
More details on this feature can be found [here](../../docs/low-code-spark/gems/conditional_execution).

#### Revamped Prophecy Fabrics UI

We are excited to announce the revamped Prophecy Fabrics user interface (UI), designed to achieve feature parity with the Databricks cluster creation flow. This significant update ensures that users have a seamless experience and consistent options when creating clusters within Prophecy.
The new UI introduces an enhanced Job sizes interface that captures all the options and flexibility provided by Databricks for cluster creation. These Job sizes can be leveraged to create clusters when execution Pipeline through Prophecy or scheduling Jobs through Prophecy.
With this improvement, users can easily configure and customize clusters to meet their specific requirements, ensuring optimal performance and resource allocation for their data processing tasks.
Please read more about this feature [here](https:/docs.prophecy.io/concepts/fabrics/create-a-fabric#databricks).

#### New Features in Low Code Airflow

Following our recent General Availability Announcement for Low Code Airflow, we are excited to introduce additional features that further enhance the capabilities of the platform.

In this release, we have introduced new Gems in Low Code Airflow Jobs, enabling users to incorporate more functionality into their Airflow DAGs.
Users can now easily add the following operators to their DAGs: Slack Operator, Email Operator, HTTP Sensor, and File Sensors. These operators expand the range of actions and triggers available, providing users with more flexibility in designing their data workflows.
Furthermore, we are pleased to announce that we have extended support for scheduling DBT projects from private Git repositories. This enhancement allows users to seamlessly integrate and schedule DBT projects hosted in private repositories, providing greater security and control over their data transformation processes.

### Minor Improvements {#UXImprovements311}

#### Ability to Attach Cluster to multiple Pipelines for Interactive Run

Previously, users could only connect a cluster to a single Pipeline, limiting their ability to use Prophecy in multiple tabs.
With this enhancement, users can now attach clusters to different Pipelines in different tabs, enabling concurrent connections without interference.
This improvement offers increased flexibility and productivity, allowing users to seamlessly switch between Pipeline configurations, perform parallel analyses, and efficiently manage data workflows.

#### Alert and warning diagnostics for User passing plain text Username password in Gems

Using hardcoded usernames and passwords is not recommended when working with Gems.
This approach can result in unsafe code, as the credentials may be exposed in your configured Git repository for the Project.
We have added In place Warnings and Diagnostics if Users are using plain text Passwords in Gems. Read about the recommended usage [here](https:/docs.prophecy.io/low-code-spark/best-practices/use-dbx-secrets)

#### Improved Entity Discovery on Info Pages

To enhance the discoverability of our entities, we try to provide comprehensive information on related entities directly on the info page.
When viewing a Project's info page, users can now see all associated Pipelines, Jobs, Datasets, and Subgraphs contained within the Project.
Likewise, when accessing a Pipeline's info page, users can easily identify the Jobs utilizing the Pipeline, as well as all Published Subgraphs that are used within the Pipeline.
For Datasets, users can quickly discover all Pipelines that utilize the Dataset.
