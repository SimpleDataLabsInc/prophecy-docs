Seeds are small CSV-format files that you can write directly in Prophecy.

## Source parameters

Seeds can only be sources. The following table describes the required parameters for Seed gems.

| Parameter       | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type and Format | Select `Seed`.                                                      |
| Properties      | Define certain properties of the table, including the table schema. |
| Preview         | Load the data to see a preview before saving.                       |

:::note
The Location tab of the Seed configuration is grayed out. This is because seeds are stored as CSV files in your project code.
