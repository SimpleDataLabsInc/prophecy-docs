## Prophecy for Analysts

### Features {#analyst-features}

The following features are available in this release.

- Create custom templates for AI pipeline documentation generation using [Copilot Template Language (CTL)](/analysts/ai-ctl-reference). CTL extends Markdown with special markers that generate interactive components like question forms, visual pipeline diagrams, and dynamic content that automatically updates based on your pipeline structure.

- Use Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) as a source and target in your pipelines with the [ADLS gem](/analysts/adls-gem). The gem supports reading and writing CSV, JSON, Parquet, XLSX, and XML files. Source gems can read from specific file paths with wildcard support or dynamically process files from file arrival triggers.

### Enhancements {#analyst-enhancements}

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- Schedule automated indexing for the [knowledge graph indexer](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/knowledge-graph-config) to run hourly, daily, or weekly. The schedule supports custom timezone configuration, with the default timezone matching your Prophecy access location.

- Configure separate authentication credentials for the [knowledge graph indexer](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/knowledge-graph-config), independent from pipeline execution credentials. Use Service Principal OAuth for production environments where credentials don't expire, or User OAuth for development scenarios.

- Configure LLM provider credentials and model specifications directly from the Prophecy UI in [Copilot Settings](/administration/cluster-admin-settings/copilot-settings). Add credentials for multiple LLM providers, define smart and fast models for different task types, and configure speech-to-text and text-to-speech models. Sensitive credential values are automatically masked after saving.
