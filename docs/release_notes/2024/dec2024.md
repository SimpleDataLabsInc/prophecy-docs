#### Databricks OAuth integration

Prophecy has integrated with Databricks OAuth in order to provide you with increased security via industry-standard authentication flows.

You will see a login overlay in Prophecy, such as whe selecting a Fabric, where Databricks API interactions are required.

The Databricks OAuth setup must be completed by both your Databricks Account Admin and your Prophecy Team Admin.

For more information on how it works and how to set it up, see Databricks OAuth.

#### Active and Total Users APIs

You can use the Active Users and Total Users APIs to find out the number of current and total users who are logged in to Prophecy. This can help you understand usage and times of high traffic, enabling you to manage capacity more effectively.

For more information on the APIs, see Active and Total Users.

### Minor Improvements {#MinorImprovements342}

- **Execution Metrics bug fix**: We fixed a bug where Execution Metrics is disabled but turns on during interactive execution.

- **Blank config package field bug fix**: We fixed a bug where a Python Pipeline would crash after clearing the config package name and then attempting to save.
