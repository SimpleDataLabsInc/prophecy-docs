## Generate pipelines with Copilot

Before you can start analyzing your data, you need to make sure that the data is collected, stored, and transformed into a usable format. While this traditionally falls to data engineers, anyone can use Prophecy to convert business specifications into pipelines.

Whether you create a pipeline through the intuitive visual interface or use Copilot to automatically generate pipelines, Prophecy will compile it into production-ready code that can be refined and validated by data engineers.
