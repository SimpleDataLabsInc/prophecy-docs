SQL projects are highly extensible, meaning you can add additional capabilities and functionalities beyond our out-of-the-box offerings. When you build new components in Prophecy, you can package, version, and share them for collaboration and control. You can accomplish this using the following features.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
