In a **Basic Subgraph**, you have the capability to encapsulate multiple distinct Gems within a single, reusable parent Gem. This organizational approach enhances the visual clarity of your Pipeline by grouping various sections together under a common parent Gem. Additionally, it empowers users to break down intricate logic into modular components, thereby streamlining the Data Engineering process.

Furthermore, the ability to [Publish a Subgraph](/docs/package-hub/package-builder/ShareableSubgraphs.md) extends the utility beyond a singular Pipeline. By doing so, you can reuse the encapsulated logic in other pipelines or projects, promoting code re-usability and simplifying the overall development workflow.

## Create a Subgraph

## Make Subgraph for existing Gems

## Subgraph Configurations

Like [Pipeline Configurations](../../configuration/configuration.md), In Subgraph Configs, User can define values that can be set at the Subgraph level and then be accessed inside any component in the Subgraph.
These will also reflect under Configurations of Pipelines using these Subgraphs, but they can only be edited from Subgraph configs.
