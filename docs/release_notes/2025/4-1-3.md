## Prophecy for Analysts

### Features {#analyst-features}

The following features are available in this release.

- The new [Pipeline gem](/analysts/pipeline-trigger-gem) lets you trigger another pipeline from within the current pipeline. You can use trigger conditions, pass parameters, and receive metadata for each run. Each gem execution can trigger the target pipeline multiple times, running sequentially until all runs finish.

- We've added a feature that lets you divide your pipeline into logical sections using [visual containers](/analysts/containers) for canvas organization.

- You can now [move projects](/analysts/migrate-managed-projects) hosted in a Prophecy-managed Git repository into an external repository without having to clone the project.

- Prophecy provides the following new gems in this release.

  - [CountRecords](/analysts/count-records): Count the number of rows in a dataset using different methods.
  - Directory: List files and folders of a specified directory from a data ingress/egress connection.
  - [DataMasking](/analysts/data-masking): Obfuscate sensitive string data in one or more columns.
  - [DataEncoderDecoder](/analysts/encode-decode): Encode or decode data in selected columns using a variety of techniques.
  - [FindDuplicates](/analysts/find-duplicates): Filters rows in a dataset based on how frequently they appear.
  - [RecordID](/analysts/record-id): Generate row-level IDs using UUID for randomly generated values or incremental ID for sequential values.
  - DynamicInput: Run SQL queries that update automatically based on your incoming data
  - Azure Synapse Source: Using our new Azure Synapse connection, you can read data from Microsoft SQL Server hosted on Azure Synapse dedicated SQL pools.
  - [Fixed-width Source](/analysts/fixed-width): Read fixed-width files from various file storage accessed from connections.

### Enhancements {#analyst-enhancements}

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- You can now enable or disable [auto-run](/analysts/app-settings) for Prophecy Apps in the app settings.

- We have improved the Knowledge Graph in the following ways:

  - After the first full crawl of a fabric, subsequent crawls are now incremental, based on differences between cached Knowledge Graph data and the latest warehouse data. This greatly improves crawl performance.

  - Progress is now displayed at the schema level instead of at the database level, providing more granular tracking.

  - Crawls can now be cancelled while in progress.

- When you open a gem, you can now collapse the **Ports** panel of the gem configuration dialog.

- We've added a **File Encoding** property to [CSV Source and Target](/analysts/csv) gems. This lets you decode CSV files when reading and encode CSV files when writing.

## Prophecy for Engineers

### Features {#engineer-features}

The following features are available in this release.

- You can now define [project-level configurations](/engineers/configurations) that are shared across all pipelines within a project.

### Enhancements {#engineer-enhancements}

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- Prophecy can now capture [execution metrics](/engineers/execution-metrics/) for pipelines that run using Selective [data sampling](/engineers/data-sampling) mode.

- The **Vanilla** [data sampling](/engineers/data-sampling) mode has been removed from the UI. Pipelines that currently use Vanilla will continue to run as expected; however, once the sampling mode is changed, you wonâ€™t be able to switch back to Vanilla. We recommend updating all pipelines from Vanilla to Selective mode.
