## Features

### Prophecy for Business Analysts

This major release is packed with new features that are a part of Prophecy for Business Analysts! We have totally revamped our platform to accommodate the needs of business analysts, providing the following new features:

- **Easy ingestion from and output to external sources**. Use the new Prophecy Automate to ingest from and send data to external sources like Sharepoint or Amazon S3.
- **New SQL gems**. We have added a treasure trove of new SQL gems for different data sources, data transformations, and reporting channels to provide all the functionality you might need to build a complete pipeline in your SQL project.
- **Version history and project publication**. Manage the history of your SQL projects using our simplified versioning workflow! When you save your or publish your project using this new flow, your project will still be versioned in a Git repository in the backend.
- **Stronger integration with data providers via Connections**. Set up a variety of connections in Prophecy to different data providers such that you can browse and add data from these sources directly in your Prophecy project.
- **Prophecy-hosted secret management**. Use Prophecy-hosted secrets for data ingestion and egress while using Prophecy Automate.
- **Monitoring via the Observability page**. Review the different tabs of the new Observability page to see all of your deployed projects, scheduled pipelines, run history, and performance.
- **Data profiling**. See a high-level overview of your data to understand it at a glance.
- **Data diff**. Ensure that your target data at the end of your pipeline matches your expectations.
- **Business applications**. Package complex pipelines into easy-to-use applications for non-technical users.

## Updates

### Read CSV files with Pandas

When you read a [CSV](/engineers/csv) file using a Source gem, you can now read the file with Pandas. To do so, you must be using a Sharepoint or SFTP location. This feature is for **Python projects** only.
