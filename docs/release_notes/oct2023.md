### Features {#FeaturesRelease321}

#### Advance Settings for Releases and Deployments

In this latest update, we are introducing advanced settings for releases and deployments to empower Project Admins with finer control.
Regular project releases handle the deployment of Pipelines, Gems, and Jobs to designated environments.
With this enhancement, users have the flexibility to redeploy previously created release versions and opt to deploy specific jobs during the deployment process. These capabilities, among others, are now easily accessible through the Prophecy UI.

For more details on these exciting features, please refer to the [documentation](/docs/releases-and-deployment/releases-and-deployment.md).
