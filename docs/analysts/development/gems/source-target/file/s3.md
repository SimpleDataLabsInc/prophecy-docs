## Create an S3 gem

To create an S3 Source or Target gem in your pipeline:

1. Set up your S3 connection.

   Learn more in the [S3 connection](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/connections/s3) documentation.

1. Add a new Source or Target gem to your pipeline canvas and open the configuration.
1. In the **Type** tab, select **S3**.
1. In the **Location** tab, choose your [file format](#supported-file-formats) and location.

   For more information on how to configure this screen, jump to [Source location](#source-location) and [Target location](#target-location).

1. In the **Properties** tab, set the file properties. These vary based on the file type that you are working with.

   See the list of properties per [file type](/analysts/file-types).

1. In the **Preview** tab, load a sample of the data and verify that it looks correct. Source gems only.
