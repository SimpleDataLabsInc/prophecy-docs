To get started with Prophecy, you must first understand _how_ you are going to use Prophecy. Will you try to extract business insights from the data, or are you more focused on ensuring that data is available and reliable? Are you identifying data trends, or are you monitoring data quality? Do you want to optimize the computation of data pipelines, or do you want to build pipelines that prepare data for reporting?

Based on these answers, you may choose to get started with data analysis, or instead get started with data engineering.

## Quick starts

```mdx-code-block
<CardContainer>
  <Card title="Data Analysis Quick Start" to="./quick-starts">
    Try building a pipeline that leverages SQL to
    prepare some data for analysisâ€”no coding necessary.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Engineering Quick Start | Spark" to="./quick-starts">
    Develop your first data pipeline and review the generated Spark code.
  </Card>
    <Card title="Engineering Quick Start | SQL" to="./quick-starts">
