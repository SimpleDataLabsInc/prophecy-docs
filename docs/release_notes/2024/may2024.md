### Features

#### Airflow Task outputs as Interims

We are excited to introduce Airflow Interims, a new feature that enhances the Airflow development experience.
In Airflow,you can output data from one Gem and easily utilize it in any downstream Gems. These outputs are now displayed as Interims, making it simpler to build your Jobs interactively.
More detailed document on this feature to follow soon.

#### Tests in SQL IDE

With this release, we have added support for visually designed SQL Tests.
You can now add tests for any seeds, models, snapshots, or sources within your project, ensuring better data integrity and quality.
More detailed document on this feature coming soon.

#### New Gems in Spark

We have expanded our Spark development environment with new Gems, including support for Iceberg (Python only) and Synapse Dataset Gems.

### Minor UX Improvements

- **Search for Gems**: For SQL and Airflow development, we have added a search function for the Gem dropdowns and added a new search feature in the top left corner, allowing you to search across the project.
