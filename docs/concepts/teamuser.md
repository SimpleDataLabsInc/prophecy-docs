## Teams and Users

Teams represent a group of users who work together

- Teams are the primary mechanism of ownership
  - **Teams own projects** where Pipelines, Datasets and Jobs live
  - **Teams own execution Fabrics** that provide the execution and storage resources for execution including Spark clusters
- Users get access via teams
  - **Personal Teams** For every user, a default team in created that only contains one user. If only one user is to be given access to a project, it can be done via this team
  - **Personal Projects** Users can put personal projects in their _personal team_ and not share it with others
