Seeds are small CSV-format files that you can create in Prophecy to use as Source gems.

## Source parameters

Seeds can only be sources. The following table describes the required parameters for seeds.

| Parameter       | Description                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type and Format | Select `Seed`.                                                       |
| Properties      | Copy-paste your CSV data and define certain properties of the table. |
| Preview         | Load the data to see a preview before saving.                        |

:::note
The **Location** tab of the seed configuration is grayed out. This is because seeds are stored as CSV files in your project code.
