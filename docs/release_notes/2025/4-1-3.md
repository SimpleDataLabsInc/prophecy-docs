### Enhancements {#engineer-enhancements}

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- New Spark pipelines will now use **Selective** [data sampling](/engineers/data-sampling) mode by default (previously **All** mode).

- The **Vanilla** [data sampling](/engineers/data-sampling) mode has been removed from the UI. Pipelines that currently use Vanilla will continue to run as expected; however, once the sampling mode is changed, you wonâ€™t be able to switch back to Vanilla. We recommend updating all pipelines from Vanilla to Selective mode.

- Prophecy can now capture [execution metrics](/engineers/execution-metrics/) for pipelines that run using Selective data sampling mode.
