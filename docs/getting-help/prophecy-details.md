Gather logs from your Prophecy environment and send them to the support team via the [Support Portal](https://prophecy.zendesk.com/).

## Send runtime logs

If you are having trouble running a pipeline, you can download the [runtime logs](/analysts/logs).

Our Support team can review these logs to help troubleshoot your issue.

## Send connection logs

If you have trouble connecting to your fabric, send connection logs to Prophecy with the corresponding error [code](docs/getting-help/diagnostics.md).

To retrieve the connection log, open the cluster connection in the top right corner of your project and click the **Copy** button.
