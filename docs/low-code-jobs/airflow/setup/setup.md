To connect to a running Airflow Instance, you would need to create a [Fabric](/docs/concepts/fabrics/fabrics.md) of type Airflow.
Prophecy provides you with three different types of Fabrics depending upon where your Airflow Instance is running.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
