Connections let you integrate your data from external data providers right in the Prophecy platform. This way, you can browse and search for your data natively while developing a project.

Secrets let you create connections securely and privately using [secret providers](docs/administration/connections-and-secrets/secret-providers.md). Secrets can also be used throughout your pipelines for various purposes.
