## 3.4.2.\* (December 13, 2024)

- Prophecy Python libs version: 1.9.28
- Prophecy Scala libs version: 8.6.0

### Features {#Features342}

#### Databricks OAuth integration

[Prophecy has integrated with Databricks OAuth](/oauth-setup) to provide you with increased security via industry-standard authentication flows. When enabled, you will see a login overlay in Prophecy, such as when selecting a fabric, where Databricks API interactions are required.

:::info Dedicated SaaS
To enable this feature, Databricks account admins **need to create an app connection** in Databricks, and Prophecy cluster admins need to input this information in Prophecy. View [Databricks OAuth](/oauth-setup) to review more specific steps.

### Minor Improvements {#MinorImprovements342}

- **"Offset" column name bug fix**: We fixed a bug where naming a column using a Snowflake reserved keyword, such as "Offset", would break when using a Reformat gem.

- **Support for null values in unit tests**: When upgrading the Scala `prophecy-libs` version to 8.6.0 or later and the Python `prophecy-libs` version to 1.9.27 or later, you may notice differences in the Prophecy-managed files related to unit tests. Specifically, changes might occur in the `prophecy/tests/*.json` files. Any null values in these files will be replaced with empty strings (`""`). This change does not affect existing unit tests, and they will continue to function as before. These files are managed by Prophecy and are not used during pipeline execution.

  There is a new option under the three dots of the unit test data table to **Set value as Null** in columns.

- **New Spark fabric diagnostic error codes**: There are new diagnostic error codes for the following failures:

  - Unable to reach Databricks endpoint.
  - Unable to write execution metrics because Hive Metastore is not enabled on your Spark.
  - Authentication fails while attempting to test a Spark fabric connection.

  For more information, see [Diagnostics](docs/getting-help/diagnostics.md).
