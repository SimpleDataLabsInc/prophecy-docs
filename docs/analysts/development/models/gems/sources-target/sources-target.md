Model sources and targets vary slightly from those of the pipeline. The primary difference is that all model sources and targets must point to tables in the SQL warehouse.

## Sources

When you create a new model, you need to define an input data source. The data source can be:

- Another model. You can drag a model from the Project tab of the left sidebar onto your canvas to use it as a source.
- A [Table gem](/analysts/table). You can either use pre-configured tables from the Project tab of the left sidebar, or you can browse SQL warehouse tables in the Environment tab of the left sidebar.

## Targets

Target models let you define how you want to materialize your data using write formats.

### Target model tabs

When you open a Target model configuration, you'll see the following tabs:

- **[Type & Format](type-and-format.md)**: Update the format of the model between different types of materializations
- **[Location](location.md)**: Update the location by overwriting the Database, Schema, or Alias
- **[Schema](schema.md)**: Make schema changes
- **[SQL Query](sql-query.md)**: View and enable your custom SQL query
- **[Write Options](write-options.md)**: Use Write Modes such as Overwrite, Append, and Merge

### dbt advanced settings

You can find advanced settings are available for defining model write formats and other DBT options. These include all dbt native settings, traditionally accessible from the `.yaml` file.

To open dbt advanced settings, click **...** > **Advanced Settings**. The object properties describe everything from physical locations, materialization logic, business metadata, and access control definitions.

### dbt properties mapping

The following table maps all of the dbt properties for Databricks and Snowflake to the tabs of Prophecyâ€™s Target model:
