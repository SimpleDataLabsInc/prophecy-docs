## 3.4.\* (October 28, 2024)

- Prophecy Python libs version: 1.9.16
- Prophecy Scala libs version: 8.2.1

### Features {#Features34}

#### Spark Copilot Enhancements {#Spark34}

- **a**:

#### SQL Copilot Enhancements {#SQL34}

- **Data tests**: We now support model and column data tests, which are dbt macro generated tests that can be parametrized and applied to a given model or any number of columns.

  You can create a new data test definition to use in your model or column test, or you can use an out-of-the-box supported dbt Simple data test.

  For more information, see Use model and column tests.

- **Variant type support**: You can use Prophecy to parse your semi-structured data types, and convert them into flat, structured formats to make them easier to understand and use for analytics. This is available for when you want to determine the variant schema of your Snowflake array or object.

  ![Schema and column selector](./img/variant-infer-schema.png)

  Using the variant schema functionality, you can do the following:

  - Parse JSON formats
  - Infer the variant schema
  - Configure the parsing limit for inferring the column structure
  - Use a nested column inside of the Visual Expression Builder

  For more information, see Variant schema.

- **Flatten schema Gem**: When processing raw data it can be useful to flatten complex data types like `Struct`s and `Array`s into simpler, flatter schemas. This Gem builds upon the variant type support by allowing you to preserve all schemas, and not just the first one.

  FlattenSchema works on Snowflake sources that have nested columns that you'd like to extract into a flat schema.

  For more information, see Flatten schema.

- **Deduplicate Gem**: You can use the dedupliate Gem to removes rows with duplicate values of specified columns. There are four **Row to keep** options that you can use in your deduplicate Gem.

  For more information, see Deduplicate.

- **Gem builder**: You can add custom Gems to your SQL projects using the Gem builder. You can create custom source, target, and transformation Gems, and then publish them for your team to use.

  Our SQL Gem builder supports Databricks and Snowflake SQL.

  For more information, see Gem builder.

### Minor Improvements {#MinorImprovements34}

- **Code diff on merge screen**: You can view the code changes of your commit when you start the process to commit changes. This gives you granular change visibility so that you can understand the detailed changes being made to your Pipelines, Models, datasets, and other entities.

  ![View Git code changes](./img/git-code-changes.png)

  You can also use manual merge to resolve conflicts. This provides you with simple, yet effective ways to resolve merge conflicts for granular changes. For SQL, you can also toggle on **Code Changes** to view and edit the code before validating. You can resolve conflicts by making code changes directly on the files.

  For more information, see the Git docs.

- **Updated Explain dialog design**: We've updated the Explain dialog design so that it's cleaner and easier to use.

  ![Explain summary design](./img/explain-summary-design.png)

- **Sourcing init scripts from volumes in the Prophecy Job sizes UI**: We now support UC clusters using Volumes

- **Prophecy Lib version**: You can now find out what the current Prophecy Library version is on your clusters. Use the Cluster Attached dropdown to see the log for the current version in the Fabric connection logs.
