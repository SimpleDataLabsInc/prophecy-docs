List files and folders of a specified directory from a data ingress/egress connection.

## Input and Output

The Directory gem does not accept any inputs.

The Directory gem produces one output. The output schema includes the following columns:

- `name`: The name of the file.
- `path`: The full path to the file.
- `size_in_bytes`: The size of the file. Folders will be listed as `0` bytes.
- `creation_time`: The time that the file was created.
- `modification_time`: The time that the file was last modified.
- `parent_directory`: The parent directory of the file or folder.
- `file_type`: Whether the record listed is a file or a folder.
- `sheet_name`: The name of the excel sheet in an XLSX file. This column appears when the **Include sheet name as column in output for xlsx files** parameter is enabled.

If a certain connection does not provide a certain field (for example, Databricks does not provide creation time), then the columns will be populated with zeroes or null values.

## Parameters

Configure the Directory gem using the following parameters.

| Select or create connection                           | New or existing connection to the provider you selected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Path                                                  | Path to directory that you want to see the contents of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Enable to include files/directories inside subfolders | When enabled, the gem recursively traverses and include all files and directories within subdirectories of the specified path.                                                                                                                                                            |
| File pattern (Optional)                               | Regular expression (regex) pattern used to narrow results to matching entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Include sheet name as column in output for xlsx files | When enabled, the gem adds a column to the output that includes XLSX sheet names. If a file has multiple sheets, one row is generated per sheet name. For example, a file with three sheets produces three rowsâ€”one for each sheet. This field is `null` if the file is not an XLSX file. |
