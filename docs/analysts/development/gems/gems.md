[Gems](/docs/getting-started/concepts/gems.md) are functional units in a pipeline that perform tasks such as reading, transforming, writing, or handling other data operations. When you build pipelines in a SQL project, some gems will be powered by the Prophecy runtime, and some gems will be powered by SQL dbt.
