## Features

### Expanded business rules capabilities

The new [business rule](docs/Spark/functions/business-rules-engine/business-rules-engine.md) capabilities include:

- Setting a timeframe in which business rules should apply.
- Automatic detection of conflicting rule logic.
- Defining multiple output columns per business rule.

## Updates

### New custom gem function

When you are [building a custom Spark gem](docs/extensibility/gem-builder/gem-builder-reference.md), you can include the `customOutputSchemaEnabled` function in your gem code to enable or disable to **Custom Schema** toggle by default. This toggle can be found in the **Output** tab of a gem.

### Advanced mode for SQL target model

When you want to [overwrite the default database](docs/data-modeling/gems/target-models/location.md) for your target model, you can now use **advanced mode** to dynamically populate the field. Rather than inputting a simple string, you can now use functions, values, and variables in your database definition.

### Use multiple unique keys

Previously when writing a SQL model using an [SCD 2 merge approach](/data-modeling/gems/target-models/write-options), you could only define one unique key. This update lets you define one or more unique keys.

### Multi-tenancy support for Hashicorp Vault

When you set up Hashicorp Vault as a secret provider, a new optional **Namespace** field lets you specify the isolated environment in your Vault.

### Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for BigQuery

BigQuery SQL fabrics now include a field that lets you include your CMEK. This way, you can access datasets protected by CMEK in Prophecy.

## Fixes

### Improved performance on UC shared clusters

We have removed some redundancy and have fixed how partial runs execute on Databricks UC shared clusters.

### Allow use of tables with quotes

This fix lets you use Snowflake tables that include quotation marks in the table name.

### Better error detection in Gem Builder

Errors captured from sandbox are now displayed with a stacktrace showing the lines in your code which caused an exception to be thrown.
