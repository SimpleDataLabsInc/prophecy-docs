This documentation is designed to help administrators effectively manage users, resources, and configurations. There are two types of administrators: team admins and Prophecy cluster admins. The navigation is divided by admin type to help you find relevant tasks.

### Team admins

Team admins manage teams and create resources for their [teams](docs/administration/teams-users/teamuser.md). This includes responsibilities like:

- Adding and removing users from teams
- Creating fabrics that correspond to different execution environments
- Setting up connections with the appropriate credentials
- Deploying projects to run scheduled pipelines

There can be multiple team admins per team.

### Prophecy cluster admins

Prophecy cluster admins manage clusters, infrastructure, compute resources, and Prophecy deployment. This includes responsibilities such as:

- Setting up authentication like SSO for the Prophecy environment
- Managing audit log review and storage
- Upgrading Prophecy to a newer version
- Downloading system logs to send to Prophecy's Support team

Prophecy automatically provisions one Prophecy cluster admin per deployment.
