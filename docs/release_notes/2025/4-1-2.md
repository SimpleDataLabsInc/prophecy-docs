## Features

The following features are available in this release.

- Prophecy fabrics now support Google BigQuery as the SQL Warehouse Connection. Learn how to set up your [BigQuery connection](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/connections/bigquery).

- We have added support for Databricks serverless compute to execute PySpark project pipelines. For a list of supported features and limitations, visit [Databricks serverless compute for PySpark](/administration/fabrics/Spark-fabrics/databricks/databricks-serverless).

- You can now write and call [stored procedures](/analysts/stored-procedure) in SQL projects that run in your BigQuery warehouse. This can be especially useful for projects migrated from other systems.

- You can now configure pipeline schedules to trigger pipeline runs according to [file arrivals or changes](/analysts/triggers#file-arrival-or-change-trigger) in a specified SFTP or S3 location.

- Prophecy provides the following new gems in this release:

  - Pivot

  - Unpivot

## Enhancements

The following enhancements are available in this release.

- We have improved the release flow for protected branches. When a branch like `main` is protected, direct commits to it are not allowed. Our previous release process required a direct commit to `main`, which caused issues in these scenarios. We now provide an option on the Open Pull Request screen to bump the version of the source branch before merging into main. To learn more, visit [Pull requests](/engineers/git-pull-requests).

- Allow merge from default branch into another branch. Previously you could not select the default branch to merge into another.

- DBX file upload parquet support
