## LLM backend configuration

Prophecy Express Edition requires a customer-provided endpoint for an LLM to power Prophecy AI. Contact Support to configure the model and model provider you will use. For more information, visit [Prophecy AI](/prophecy-ai).

## User administration

### Create teams

Before you can invite users to Prophecy, you need to define the [teams](/administration/teams-users/teams-users) they will be invited to.

1. Navigate to your Prophecy Express Edition instance URL.
1. Use the admin credentials provided during your initial setup.
1. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Teams**.
1. Click **Create Team**.
1. Fill in the team details and click **Complete**.

How you configure teams will depend on your individual use case.

### Create users

After you define the teams, invite new users to those teams.

1. On the Teams page in Settings, click **Add Users**.
1. Fill out the user details and click **Invite**.

   This creates a new user account and sends an invitation link to the user.

1. In the confirmation dialog, copy the invitation link if needed, and click **Done**.

:::note
Express Edition supports up to 20 users maximum with a cap of five simultaneous users.

### Set up Git credentials

Projects are stored as code hosted on Git repositories. You can use a Prophecy-managed Git repository an external Git repository.

If using external Git repositories, users need to store their Git credentials in Prophecy.

- [Learn how to add new Git credentials to Prophecy](/engineers/git#Git-credentials).
- [Share saved Git credentials with Prophecy team members](/engineers/git#shared-credentials).

If you want to give multiple users access to a certain shared Git account, following the linked instructions on how to share Git credentials with a team. When a user creates a new project, they'll be able to select any empty Git repository this account has access to to store their project code. They'll also be able to clone existing project repositories to this account.

### Optional: Configure SSO with Okta

Express Edition supports Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with Okta. Learn more about setting up Okta in our [SAML documentation](/administration/authentication/saml-scim#saml-configuration).

If you're not using SSO, users must use the exact same email addresses for their Prophecy accounts as they use for authenticating with Databricks. This ensures proper authentication flow between platforms.

:::info Important
Express Edition **does not** support SCIM.
:::

## Create fabrics

A fabric in Prophecy defines the execution environment for your pipelines. To set up your execution environment:

- Create a [Prophecy fabric](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/). You can only create fabrics for teams where you are the [team admin](/administration/rbac).
- To add SQL warehouse connection in the fabric, set up a [Databricks connection](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/connections/databricks).
- To add data ingress/egress connections in the fabric, [follow the instructions](/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/connections/) for each type of connection.

You can create additional fabrics for different execution environments (for example, `dev` and `prod`).

### Optional: Set up Private Link

Prophecy Express Edition requires connectivity from Prophecy to Databricks REST API endpoints. Connections originate from Prophecy to Databricks, so you may need to configure **Private Link** or **IP allowlist/firewall exception** to ensure network connectivity.

To learn how to set up Private Link for Databricks, visit:

- [Enable private connectivity using AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/classic/privatelink)
- [Enable Azure Private Link back-end and front-end connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/classic/private-link)

Once you have set up Private Link, send our Support team your endpoint so we can set up connectivity to Prophecy's VPC.

:::info
Other connection types may have different networking requirements depending on your setup. If any connections fail, make sure that your networking configuration allows communication to and from Prophecy.

## Modernize existing workflows

If you're migrating from Alteryx, Prophecy Express Edition includes a transpiler to convert your existing workflows.

1. Use the **Alteryx Transpiler** to import your existing workflows.
2. Review and refine the converted pipelines.
3. Test the pipelines in the Prophecy environment.
4. Deploy the modernized workflows.

For more information, visit our [Transpiler documentation](https://transpiler.docs.prophecy.io/).
