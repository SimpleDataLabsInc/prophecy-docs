Containers allow you to divide your pipeline into logical sections. They help you visually organize related gems, making pipelines easier to read and debug. Containers are visual tools that donâ€™t affect how your pipeline runs.

## Create a visual container

1. In the pipeline canvas, click **+ Container** from the toolbar.
2. Drag the new container onto the canvas.
3. Give it a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `Staging`, `Filter Invalid`, `Aggregate`).

## Move gems to and from containers

- Drag gems into the container area.
- You can also select multiple gems, right-click, and choose **Move to container**.

## Edit and delete container

- Click the container label to rename it.
- Drag the edges to resize.
- Right-click to delete the container (gems remain intact).

## Collapse container
