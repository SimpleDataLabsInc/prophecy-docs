## Create teams

Before you can invite users to Prophecy, you need to define the [teams](/administration/teams-users/teams-users) they will be invited to.

1. Go to **Settings → Teams**.
1. Click **Create Team**.
1. In the **Basic Info** tab, define the team name.
1. Click **Continue**.
1. **[Enterprise Edition only]** Enable or disable Spark execution metrics for the team.
1. Click **Complete** to save the new team.

## Create users

After you define the teams, invite new users to those teams.

1. Go to **Settings → Teams**.
1. Next to **Team Users**, click **Add Users**.
1. In the **Invite User** dialog:

   - Select the team the user will join.
   - Enter the user’s email address. This becomes their Prophecy account email.
   - Enter the company name.
   - Enter the first name.
   - (Optional) Enter the last name.
   - Turn the Admin toggle on or off. If on, the user becomes a team admin.

1. Click **Invite**. The system creates the account and emails the invitation link to the user.
1. In the confirmation dialog, copy the invitation link if needed, then click **Done**.
