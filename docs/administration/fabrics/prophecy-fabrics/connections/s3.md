The S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) connection in Prophecy enables you to integrate with AWS S3, which is a scalable object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data.

| Access Key ID                                                                 | Your AWS access key ID                                         |
| Secret Access Key ([Secret required](docs/administration/secrets/secrets.md)) | Your AWS secret access key                                     |
| Region                                                                        | AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1`) |
| Bucket Name                                                                   | Name of your S3 bucket                                         |

## S3 permissions

When you create an S3 connection in Prophecy, access permissions are tied to the AWS credentials you use. This means you will only see the files and folders your these credentials have permission to access. Any data operations—such as reading from or writing to tables—are executed using your credentials.

To fully leverage an S3 connection in Prophecy, you need the following permissions:

- For a bucket: `List`, `Write`
- For an object/file: `Read`, `Write`

## Sharing connections within teams

Connections in Prophecy are stored within [fabrics](docs/administration/fabrics/prophecy-fabrics/prophecy-fabrics.md), which are assigned to specific teams. Once an S3 connection is added to a fabric, all team members that have access to the fabric can use the connection in their projects. No additional authentication is required—team members automatically inherit the access and permissions of the original connection.

:::caution
Be mindful of the access level granted by the stored credentials. Anyone on the team will have the same permissions—including access to sensitive data if allowed.

To manage this securely, consider creating a dedicated fabric and team for high-sensitivity connections. This way, only approved users have access to those credentials.

## Fetching data

Prophecy fetches data from S3 connections in the following ways:

- When you browse an S3 connection in the [Environment browser](/analysts/pipelines), Prophecy fetches data on demand as you expand folders. You can manually refresh the Environment browser to see updated files.

- When a pipeline runs, Source gems will read the latest available version of the data. If the schema of the data stored in S3 changes, you will need to re-infer the schema in Prophecy.
