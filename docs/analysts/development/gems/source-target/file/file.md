Prophecy supports the following file types.

- CSV
- Excel
- JSON
- Parquet
- XML

Depending on the connection type you choose in the source/target gem, you might see fewer options.

Each file type, regardless of its origin connection, has the same parameters and properties. Because of this, each file type has its own documentation. This is different from tables that have specific parameters according to the data provider.
