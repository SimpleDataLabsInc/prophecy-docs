Dependencies allow you to reuse logic in your SQL projects, so you can build on work thatâ€™s already been tested and versioned. Dependencies are scoped at the project level, and can include [packaged Prophecy projects](/engineers/package-hub), as well as external packages from GitHub or the dbt Hub.

Because packages can be improved over time, you can update your project dependencies whenever a new version is published. Your project will continue to use the current version until you choose to upgrade.

## Dependency types

There are three types of dependencies for SQL projects.

### Prophecy Project

When you import a project from the Package Hub as a dependency, you gain access to all its components, including pipelines, gems, and functions for use in your own project. If a new version of the project is [published](docs/analysts/version-control/version-control.md), you can update your dependency version to take advantage of the latest changes.

Prophecy Project dependencies have the following parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Dependencies | Choose from a dropdown list of compatible projects that are published in the Package Hub. |

### GitHub

Dependencies can be saved to GitHub repositories and imported from there.

GitHub dependencies have the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Git Repository | Link to the GitHub repository containing the dependency.                                                                                                                                          |
| Revision       | Git tag, commit hash, or branch name that points to the version that you want to import.                                                                                                          |
| Sub Directory  | Path of the subdirectory in the repository that contains the dependency (if not in the root directory).                                                                                           |
| Warn unpinned  | Whether to point to your repository without specifying any version, commit, or branch. Enabling this option may result in unexpected behavior if there are changes to your latest default branch. |

### dbt Hub

Packages in the [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) can be used to extend typical SQL functionality. If the package contains macros, you can use them via the [Macro](docs/analysts/development/gems/custom/macro.md) gem.

dbt Hub dependencies have the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Package   | Package name or path (e.g., `dbt-labs/dbt_utils`). |
| Version   | Package version or version range.                  |

## Manage dependencies

To manage your project dependencies, there are two options:

- A) Open the **Manage Dependencies** dialog by clicking **... > Dependencies** in the project header.
- B) Open the **Manage Dependencies** dialog from the bottom left of the canvas, in the **Dependencies** panel.

From here, you can add, edit, update, or remove dependencies from your project.

## Create a new dependency

To add a dependency to your project:

1. Open the **Options** (ellipses) menu in the project header.
1. Select **Dependencies**.
1. Click **+ Add Dependency**.
1. Choose the dependency type (Project, GitHub, or DBT Hub).
1. Fill in the required fields to import the correct package version.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Click **Reload and Save** to validate and download the new dependency.

:::tip
You can also browse packaged projects in the [Package Hub](/engineers/package-hub) and import them from there.

## Component usage

Depending on the dependency type, components may appear in the project differently. For example, if you add a project from the Package Hub as a dependency, new gems may appear automatically in the gem drawer.

However, all of the dependencies and their components should appear in the **Dependencies** panel in the bottom left of the project editor. Expand a dependency to view the various functions, gems, and other components that it may contain. You can drag these components directly onto the visual canvas.

## Storage

Dependencies are stored at the project level within the `packages.yml` file of the project code.
