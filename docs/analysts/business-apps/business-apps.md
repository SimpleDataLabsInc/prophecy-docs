Business applications package complex pipelines into easy-to-use applications for non-technical users. Leverage business apps to:

- Let users independently generate and access data insights.
- Simplify the process of building intricate data analysis pipelines from scratch through pre-built templates.
- Minimize repetitive efforts by using pre-set workflows instead of recreating them.

## Capabilities

Business apps resemble forms that are easy to understand and fill out. They offer the following capabilities.

- Upload data to overwrite pipeline sources.
- Assign values to [pipeline parameters](/analysts/development/pipelines#parameters).
- See live data previews.
- Download data outputs.
- Schedule app execution.

## Directory

All business apps can be accessed from the App Directory. Each business app is associated with one pipeline (one-to-one relationship).

You'll be able to view and use business apps that have been shared with your team.

Apps will always run on the last published version of the associated data pipeline.

## Creation

Business apps are created inside projects. Visit our guide on [app creation](docs/analysts/business-apps/app-creation.md) for more details.
